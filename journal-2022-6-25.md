## Journal content
Today is Jun 25th, yesterday i arrived in NanChang at night and then i went to my house in NanChang County.
NanChang County is a county of NanChang City.
Unfortunately, when i got home, i found the lights is unable to work, then i guessed the switch is turned off.
So i started to find where is the switch, eventually, i found it was hanged on the wall in the kitchen,
next step i brought a chair, then i standed on the chair and turned the switch on, then the lights works,
but it only works for about 10 seconds, the switch then turned off by itself, there was a problem in it.

It was so helpless, the temperature is so high in NanChang, but it has no way, then i spread some big papers
on the balcony as my bed.

Above is what happened to me at yesterday night.
And you may ask why i go to NanChang, it's because i will go to have a dinner with Little-Fish.
Today morning, i waked up at about 8 o'clock, what surprised is i slept very well yesterday, maybe because i was
too tired, and i felt asleep at about 1 o'clock in that night.

We decided to meet each other at about 6 p.m today.
Then i spent much time to clean my house, because it was too messy.
I sold the paper boxes what took up too much room, and then i picked up my express deliveries which arrived at here
during i was in XinYu in last about 3 months, there are about 10 deliveries, mainly some books.

Time pasted fast, when i waked up from noontime snooze, it was afternoon, i began to prepare to meet Little-Fish.
I took a bath, i washed my glasses, i shaved off my bread, i washed my shoes, 
and to dislodge the foul smell of the shoes, i poured some alcohol on tissue,
then put the tissue into the shoes.

Time now was 4:30, i wear clothes and shoes, and Little-Fish responseed my wechat message and send a 
address to me where we will meet, the address is a restaurant which called `遇江南(Yu JiangNan)`.

Then i walked out, and got a taxi to carry me to the nearest subway station.
There are more than 10 stops from the start stop to the destination stop, the destination stop is called `north of people's park.`

I arrived at `North of people's park`, the Map shows that `Yu JiangNan` only 700 meters from me.
But i could not found it, so i got a taxi again to go to there, i arrived.
I waitting for her in front of the restaurant, and sent her a message.
She lived in a rented house nearby, she arrived here in about 8 minutes, so it was the first time i meet Little-Fish!
## TODO describe the sense when we recognized each other, the street, the crowd, etc..
Recall past 2 days, i was hit by something straight, i became sensitive, maybe i'm always sensitive.
I would be melancholy when she doesn't response to me in time in wechat or reject or avoid my admiration, i felt frustrated,
i still don't know her thoughts about me.

But then i changed my perspective after one day, we are both free, i must to be her friend firstly,
to care, to follow, to help her, this world is always hardhearted, it's even worse for a girl.
Whatever the outcome, enjoy the progress.

Now i saw her, we just across a narrow street, she wear a mask, glasses, a long skirt, she wear her hairs in braids.
I recognized her, so i waved to her, then she recognized me.

We walked along street to another restaurant which called 'kitchen daddy'.

we ordered 3 dishes and then sit down, Fish removed her mask, her lip is healthy red, she smiled like a child, purity and
naturally.
We chatting while eating, we talked about old news.
