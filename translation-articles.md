## The father in the corner
帮DaJiang搬家，在整理一堆旧书籍的时候，DaJiang蹲在地上呜呜大哭起来

Helping DaJiang move house, DaJiang squatted....死扩(1)剃的.... on the ground and cried while sorting out a pile of old books
<hr>DaJiang打开的是一个笔记本，上面记着日常开支，一笔一笔，清晰到一块钱的早餐，三块钱的午餐

What DaJiang opened was a notebook, which recorded daily expenses, one by one, as clear as a one-dollar breakfast and three-dollar lunch
<hr>稍后，DaJiang给我讲了关于他和父亲的一段往事

Later, DaJiang told me a story about him and his father
<hr>DaJiang的家在徐州乡下的一个村子里，在他的记忆里，父亲一直在徐州火车站附近打短工，难得回家一次

DaJiang's home is in a village in the countryside of Xuzhou. In his memory, his father has been working part-time near Xuzhou Railway Station, and it is rare to return home once
<hr>DaJiang考上西安的一所大学时，父亲从银行取出一包钱，一张一张沾着口水数，数了一次又一次

When DaJiang was admitted to a university in Xi'an, his father took out a bag of money from the bank, counted each one with saliva, and counted them again and again
<hr>大一的时候，DaJiang迷上了网络游戏，经常整晚耗在校外的网吧里

When he was a freshman, DaJiang was addicted to online games and often spent the whole night in the Internet cafes outside the school
<hr>他虽然感觉到有些虚度光阴，但身边的同学们都差不多，不是打球，就是看电影，或者上网打游戏，DaJiang也就释然了

Although he felt a little wasted, the classmates around him were similar, either playing football, watching movies, or playing games online. , DaJiang is relieved(松了一口气)....瑞利误的....
<hr>暑假回家，DaJiang在村里待了几天，感觉特别无聊，就忐忑地对父亲提出，想去他那里玩几天

After returning home from the summer vacation, DaJiang stayed in the village for a few days and felt very bored, so he suggested to his father nervously that he wanted to go to his place to play for a few days
<hr>至少那里有网吧！父亲竟然破天荒地答应了

At least there is an Internet cafe there! Father actually agreed for the first time
<hr>远远地，DaJiang就看到父亲等在火车站的出口

From a distance, DaJiang saw his father waiting at the exit of the train station
<hr>经过一年大学生活的洗礼，DaJiang第一次感觉父亲在人群中是那么扎眼——衣服破旧，还宽大得有些不合身

After a year of baptism(洗礼)....吧普剃震.... in college, DaJiang felt for the first time that his father was so dazzling....搭自令.... in the crowd - the clothes were tattered(破烂的)....它特的.... and too large to fit
<hr>他提醒父亲，衣服太旧了

He reminded his father that the clothes were too old
<hr>父亲说，出力干活的，又不是坐办公室，穿那么新干吗？他又说，那也太大了啊

Father said that the one who worked hard was not sitting in the office, so why did he wear so new clothes? He said again, that's too big
<hr>父亲又说，衣服大点，干活才能伸展开手脚，不然，一伸手，衣服就撕破了

Father said again, the clothes are bigger, so you can stretch your hands and feet when you work, otherwise, as soon as you stretch out your hands, the clothes will be torn
<hr>让DaJiang没有想到的是，在2003年，月入就有四千多元的父亲，竟然住在一栋民房的阁楼里，只有六七平方米

What DaJiang did not expect was that in 2003, his father, who had a monthly income of more than 4,000 yuan, lived in the attic(阁楼)....阿替克.... of a private house with only six or seven square meters
<hr>除了一张铁架床之外，还有个放洗脸盆的木架子，那个多处掉瓷的搪瓷盆上，搭着一条看不出本色的旧毛巾……DaJiang一直以为，父亲在城里过的是很舒服的日子，没想到竟是这样清苦

In addition to an iron-framed bed, there is also a wooden shelf for the washbasin. On the enamel basin with many broken enamels, there is an old towel(毛巾)....套沃.... that can't be seen... DaJiang always thought that his father lived in the city. It's a very comfortable day, I didn't expect it to be so hard
<hr>父亲把DaJiang带回住处，就说：“你坐着，我要去忙活了

Father took DaJiang back to his residence, and said, "You sit, I'm going to do some work
<hr>”说着，就咚咚咚下楼走了

" Then he went downstairs and walked away
<hr>DaJiang坐不下去，就悄悄地关上门，下楼，跟在父亲身后，他想看看父亲是做什么的

 DaJiang couldn't sit down, so he quietly(安静地)....快特利.... closed the door and went downstairs, Following behind his father, he wanted to see what his father did
<hr>七弯八拐，DaJiang跟随父亲来到了徐州冷库

After a round of twists and turns, DaJiang followed his father to the Xuzhou cold storage
<hr>那儿聚集着十多个跟父亲差不多的人，有的推着推车，有的拿着扁担，DaJiang看到父亲从门卫那里推出了自己的手推车

 There were more than a dozen people who were similar to his father, some pushing carts, some carrying poles, DaJiang saw his father push out his own from the doorman. Trolley(电车)....缺利....
<hr>正在这时，一辆大货车进入大院，父亲和大伙一起，跟在车后拥了进去

At this moment, a large truck entered the compound, and my father and everyone followed behind the truck and went in
<hr>几分钟后，DaJiang看到了父亲，他弓着腰扛着大大的纸箱，走几步，停一下，用系在手腕处的毛巾擦额头的汗，再前行几步，把背上的纸箱放到手推车上，接着又奔向大货车，几秒钟后，又弓着腰扛来一个纸箱

A few minutes later, DaJiang saw his father. He hunched over a large cardboard box, walked a few steps, paused(停顿了一下)....破自的...., wiped the sweat on his forehead with a towel(毛巾)....套沃.... tied around his wrist, and walked a few steps forward, putting the cardboard box on his back. On the trolley(电车)....缺利...., then ran to the big truck, and after a few seconds, hunched over another cardboard box
<hr>如此反复七次之后，父亲推着那辆车向冰库走去，弓着腰，双腿蹬得紧紧的，几十米外的DaJiang甚至看得到父亲腿上的青筋

After repeating this for seven times, my father pushed the car towards the icehouse, hunched over his waist(腰)....为四特...., his legs clenched(握紧)....可烂趣的.... tightly(紧密)....胎特利...., and DaJiang could even see the blue veins on his father's legs from a few dozen meters away
<hr>原来父亲赚的是血汗钱！DaJiang惆怅不已

It turns out that my father earned(赢得了)....摁的.... hard-earned(赢得了)....摁的.... money! DaJiang is melancholy
<hr>他向门卫打听，搬一次货，能有多少钱？门卫告诉他，五毛钱一箱

 He asked the doorman, how much money can he make when he moves the goods? The doorman told him that it was fifty cents a box
<hr>DaJiang在心里算了一下，父亲一次运了七箱，赚三块五毛钱

DaJiang calculated in his heart that his father shipped seven boxes at a time, earning three yuan and fifty cents
<hr>DaJiang当天下午就回了家

DaJiang went home that afternoon
<hr>他不再想着上网了，他的眼前总是晃动着父亲暴着青筋的腿

 He no longer thought about surfing(冲浪)....奢fing.... the Internet, and his father's blue-veined legs were always shaking in front of his eyes
<hr>他还算了算，自己在网吧浪费了多少父亲的汗水

 He didn't even think about it, how much his father's sweat was wasted in the Internet cafe
<hr>DaJiang返校的时候，父亲又从银行里取出厚厚的一沓钱，数了又数，交给DaJiang

When DaJiang returned to school, his father took out a thick wad of money from the bank, counted it and handed it over to DaJiang
<hr>DaJiang数了一下，说，“这学期时间短，有两千就够了

DaJiang counted it and said, "This semester is short, two thousand is enough
<hr>”说着，分出一半，留给父亲

 "Speaking, split half and leave it to my father
<hr>这一天，DaJiang下决心做个好儿子，做个好学生

 On this day, DaJiang is determined to be a good son and a good student
<hr>但他的这种想法，很快成为过眼云烟

But this kind of thought quickly became a thing of the past.
<hr>当那些旧日的玩伴又吆喝着去网吧，当他有意无意地看到魔兽游戏图案，他内心里总是忍不住躁动

When those old playmates went to the Internet cafe again, when he saw the game pattern of Warcraft intentionally or not, he could not help but feel restless in his heart
<hr>终于，他又一次走进了网吧

Finally, He walked into the Internet cafe again
<hr>国庆节的时候，室友们组织去K歌，去酒吧，还去洗了桑拿

During the National Day, the roommates organized to go to karaoke, go to the bar, and even go to the sauna(桑拿)....嗦那....
<hr>从家里带来的两千块钱，到十月底就没有了

The 2,000 yuan brought(带来了)....补落特.... from home will be gone by the end of October
<hr>DaJiang给妈妈打电话，说前段时间生了一场病，带来的钱花完了

DaJiang called her mother and said that she had given birth some time ago. I fell ill, and the money I brought(带来了)....补落特.... was spent
<hr>第三天下午，西安突然降温，正在宿舍里和同学打牌的DaJiang接到电话，说校门口有人找他

On the afternoon of the third day, Xi'an suddenly cooled down. DaJiang, who was playing cards with his classmates in the dormitory(宿舍)....多密趣...., received a call saying that someone was looking for him at the school gate
<hr>DaJiang跑到校门口，看到了父亲

DaJiang ran to the school gate and saw her father
<hr>五十多岁的父亲，像个七十岁的老人，老态龙钟，一脸的疲惫，身上背着一床棉絮

Father in his fifties, like a seven-year-old A ten-year-old old man, old and tired, with a bed of cotton wool on his back
<hr>DaJiang把父亲带入校园里，才小声问他：“你怎么来了，我给妈留了账号，你把钱打入那个卡上就行了

DaJiang took his father into the campus and asked him in a low voice: "Why are you here, I left an account for my mother, you just put the money into that card
<hr>你跑这么远，还背着这个东西，又辛苦，又浪费钱

 You have run so far, carrying this thing on your back, Hard work and waste of money
<hr>”
"
<hr>父亲讨好地对他笑着，说：“听你妈说，你前段时间病了，现在怎么样了，好了没？要吃好点，照顾好自己，你不用担心生活费，只要你能吃出好身体，学出好成绩，就是再多的生活费，你爸也掏得起

His father smiled at him flatteringly, and said, "Listen to your mother, you were sick some time ago, how are you now, are you okay? Eat well, take care of yourself, you don't have to worry about living expenses, as long as you can eat Good health, good grades in school, no matter how much living expenses, your father can afford it
<hr>天冷了，这是你妈妈用自己种的棉花给你做的棉胎

It's getting cold, this is the batting your mother made for you with the cotton she planted
<hr>”DaJiang嗫嚅着说：“已经……好了……”在通往教学楼的路上，父亲说：“看到你好好的，我也就放心了，把生活费给你，我就回去

" DaJiang murmured, "It's... well..."On the way to the teaching building, my father said, "I'm relieved(松了一口气)....瑞利误的.... to see that you are fine. I'll go back after giving you the living expenses
<hr>不影响你

 It won't affect you
<hr>”DaJiang接过父亲递过来的钱，正想说带父亲到学校的招待所住，父亲又说了，“再有两个月就放寒假了吧？我这次给你带了三千块，你刚生病，要吃好点，把身子养壮点，才能有精力上好学

" DaJiang took the money from his father, I wanted to bring my father to live in the hostel of the school, but my father said again, "Winter vacation in two months? I brought(带来了)....补落特.... you 3,000 yuan this time. You just got sick, so you need to eat better and take care of yourself. Only when you are strong can you have the energy to study hard
<hr>”父亲止住脚步，“你回去吧！”DaJiang知道父亲的脾气，就不再说什么

" Father stopped, "Go back!"DaJiang knew his father's temper, so he didn't say anything anymore
<hr>他走出不远，回头的时候，发现父亲还站在原地，朝他挥手

He was not far away, when he turned around, he found his father still standing there and waved to him
<hr>他想起读高中的时候，每次父亲送他去县城的学校，都是这个场景，泪就溢满了眼睛

He remembered that when he was in high school, every time his father sent him to the school in the county seat, It's all this scene, tears overflowing my eyes
<hr>干瘪的钱包终于鼓了起来，一周不见的魔兽又在呼唤DaJiang

The shriveled purse finally swelled up, and the monster that he had not seen for a week was calling DaJiang again
<hr>晚饭过后，DaJiang又去了校外的网吧

After dinner, DaJiang went to the Internet cafe outside the school
<hr>五个小时的凶猛厮杀之后，DaJiang要回宿舍了

After five hours of fierce(激烈的)....肺叶四.... fighting, DaJiang was going back to the dormitory(宿舍)....多密趣....
<hr>和往常一样，他又来到了校外的一棵大榕树下，从那儿翻墙进校

As usual, he I came to a big banyan tree outside the school again, and climbed the wall from there to enter the school
<hr>就在他翻上墙头的那一刻，他的心一下子疼了起来！昏黄的路灯，照着他的父亲，他偎在那个墙角，身下垫着不知从哪里拣来的破纸箱

The moment he climbed over the wall, his heart suddenly ached(痛)....诶克的....! The dim streetlights shone on his father. He was leaning against the corner of the wall, with a ragged cardboard box under him.
<hr>此刻，他正把身上的棉衣裹了又裹，而自己高中时围过的围巾，紧紧地缠在父亲头上

At this moment, he was wrapping and wrapping the cotton-padded clothes on his body. Scarf, wrapped tightly(紧密)....胎特利.... around father's head
<hr>DaJiang说到这里，又忍不住放声大哭起来

DaJiang said this, he couldn't help crying again
<hr>哭了好一会儿，DaJiang又接着说：“后来我妈告诉我说，我爸听说我病了，就不顾一切地要来看我，买不到座位票，又舍不得买卧铺，站了二十多个小时来到西安

 After crying for a while, DaJiang continued: "Later my mother told me that my dad heard that I was ill and wanted to see me desperately. I couldn't buy a seat ticket, and I was reluctant(不情愿的)....瑞拉客tan特.... to buy a sleeper, so I came to Xi'an after standing for more than 20 hours
<hr>为了省下住宿的钱，在我们学校的墙角下蹲了一夜……我在电话这头就哭，在妈妈告诉我之前，我一直装作不知道

In order to save money for accommodation(住宿)....啊康摸dei迅...., I squatted....死扩(1)剃的.... in the corner of our school all night...I cried on the phone, I pretended not to know until my mother told me
<hr>因为我知道父亲的固执，我那时就是叫醒他，他也会坚持着在那里

Because I knew my father's stubbornness(固执)....死搭born逆四...., I was Even if you wake him up, he'll stick(坚持)....死剃克.... around there
<hr>我悄悄回了宿舍，可我的心里却一直疼着，想到他裹紧衣服的动作，我就心疼

I quietly(安静地)....快特利.... went back to the dormitory(宿舍)....多密趣...., but my heart was still in pain. Thinking of his action of wrapping his clothes, I felt distressed
<hr>我连夜把所有的关于游戏的账号全部删掉了

 I deleted all the accounts related to the game overnight
<hr>从那以后，我再也没有进过网吧，再也不浪费一分钱

Since then, I have never been in an Internet cafe again, and I have never wasted a penny again
<hr>也就是从那一天起，我准备了这个记账本，开始把以前落下的学业一点点补回来

 That is, from that day on, I prepared this ledger and started to make up for the schoolwork that I had lost in the past.
<hr>”“我以前一直以为是他命不好，没有享受生活的福气

”"I used to think that his life was bad and he didn't enjoy the blessings of life
<hr>经过那件事情，我才知道，不是他没有福，而是他习惯了把一切享受给予他儿子……他从十七岁开始在那个冰库做事，一直做到去年春天

 After that incident, I realized that it was not that he had no blessings, but that he was used to giving all the enjoyment to his son... He has been from the age of seventeen. Started to work in that freezer, until last spring
<hr>”DaJiang说不下去了

" DaJiang couldn't go on anymore
<hr>我知道，DaJiang的父亲于去年春天去世了，给DaJiang留下了三十七万元的存款

I know that DaJiang's father passed away last spring, leaving DaJiang with a deposit of 370,000 yuan
<hr>DaJiang的父亲是许多贫困父亲的缩影，深沉而又无私的爱

DaJiang's father is the epitome of many poor fathers, deep and selfless love
<hr>所幸的是，他的孩子看到了墙角的父亲，而我知道，还有很多孩子想不到，也看不到墙角里的爱

Fortunately, his children saw the father in the corner, and I know that there are many children who can't think of and can't see the love in the corner

## Friendship, Silence, Language
Have Foucault and Blanchot ever met? For Foucault, the answer is no. For Blanchot, the answer is yes. Foucault and Blanchot met on the campus of the Sorbonne during the May storm of 1968. On those stormy days, discussions between strangers were not abrupt. Blanchot recognized the already famous Foucault and spoke to him a few words. However, Foucault did not know that the person speaking to him was his idol Blanchot. Despite his stellar reputation, Blanchot hardly made a public appearance after World War II. He was present only by means of writing. Apart from his writings, nothing is known about him. It was only during the May storm that he appeared in public for the only time in an anonymous capacity. Of course Foucault would not recognize him. Blanchot does not give interviews to reporters, does not reveal his photos, does not participate in academic conferences, and rarely even meets his friends (including his best friend Levinas). The way he communicates with friends is to write continuously letter. He lived a life of seclusion and isolation, and as he has repeatedly expressed in his books, he endowed silence, loneliness and distance with a unique value. Instead of talking to people face to face, Blanchot takes the Nietzschean way, talking passionately to himself, a loner talking to his shadow. He often asks and answers himself in the book, having "infinite conversations" with himself. Until his death in 2003, it was unclear whether the man known as France's most famous disappearance of the twentieth century was still alive.

福柯和布朗肖见过一次吗？对于福柯来说，答案是否定的。对于布朗肖来说，答案则是肯定的。1968年五月风暴期间，福柯和布朗肖在索邦大学的校园内相遇了。在那个风起云涌的日子里，陌生人之间的讨论并不突兀。布朗肖认出了已经大名鼎鼎的福柯，并和他讲过几句话。但是，福柯并不知道同他讲话的这个人就是他的偶像布朗肖。尽管布朗肖名声显赫，但二战以后几乎从未抛头露面。他只通过写作的方式在场。除了他的著作，人们对他一无所知。只是在五月风暴期间，他才唯一一次以匿名者的身份出现在公开场合。福柯当然不会认出他来。布朗肖不接受记者采访，不暴露自己的照片，也不参加学术会议，甚至也极少同自己的朋友（包括最好的朋友列维纳斯）见面，他和朋友的交往方式就是不间断地写信。他过着隐居而隔绝的生活，就像他一再在他的书中所表达的那样，他赋予了沉默、孤独和距离以独特的价值。不和人面对面说话，布朗肖就采取尼采的方式，自己和自己热烈地谈话，一个孤独者和他的影子在说话。他常常在书中自问自答，自己和自己进行“无限的交谈”。到2003年他去世之前，人们并不清楚，这个被称为法国二十世纪最著名的失踪者，到底是否还在人世。

In the sixties, Foucault read a great deal of Blanchot. Blanchot became one of Foucault's most obsessive authors. Foucault has repeatedly and unabashedly expressed his homage to Blanchot on various occasions. He once told his friends that when he was young, he dreamed of being Blanchot. He quoted Blanchot a lot in the text. Following Blanchot's style, the self-questioning and self-answering method he adopted in the back of "The Archeology of Knowledge" is an imitation and tribute to Blanchot. Blanchot, Bataille and Krosovsky, the three philosophers and writers at the same time, were also the three authors that Foucault was obsessed with in the 1950s and 1960s. It was they who decisively led Foucault to Nietzsche. "For me, Nietzsche, Bataille, Blanchot, Krosovsky are escapes from philosophy. Bataille's rage, Blanchot's tantalizing and annoying sweetness, Krosovsky's Spirals, these are all starting from philosophy, bringing philosophy into play and questioning, out of philosophy, and back into philosophy." They both break down the line between philosophy and non-philosophy - which is also Foucault's style . However, he did not associate with them. He only met Krosovsky on the recommendation of Roland Barthes and suggested a solid friendship. While Bataille died prematurely in 1962, Blanchot, a recluse, was never seen. For Foucault, too, he was willing to maintain the mystical cult of Blanchot. Perhaps, keeping a distance is the inner tacit understanding between them. Once, a friend invited Foucault to dinner with Blanchot, but Foucault politely declined: to know him and understand him only by reading his articles. The two deliberately did not meet. But, in Blanchot's words, they "both miss each other".
<br>
<br>
在六十年代，福柯读过布朗肖的大量著作。布朗肖成为福柯最迷恋的作者之一。福柯在各种不同的场合多次毫不掩饰地表达对布朗肖的敬意。他曾对他的朋友说，他年轻的时候，梦想成为布朗肖。他在文中大量引用布朗肖的话，仿照布朗肖的风格，他在《知识考古学》后面所采用的自问自答的方式就是对布朗肖的模仿和致敬。布朗肖、巴塔耶和克罗索夫斯基，这三个人同时是哲学家和作家，他们也是福柯五六十年代迷恋的三个作者。正是他们决定性地把福柯引向了尼采。“对我来说，尼采、巴塔耶、布朗肖、克罗索夫斯基是逃离哲学的途径。巴塔耶的狂暴，布朗肖既诱人又恼人的甜蜜，克罗索夫斯基的螺旋，这些都是从哲学出发，把哲学带入游戏和疑问，从哲学中出来，再回到哲学中去。”他们都打破了哲学和非哲学的界线——这也正是福柯的风格。不过，他和他们并不来往。他只是在罗兰·巴特的引荐下同克罗索夫斯基见面并建议了牢靠的友谊。而巴塔耶1962年就过早地去世，隐居者布朗肖则从不见人。对福柯来说，他也愿意保持着对布朗肖的神秘崇拜。或许，保持距离，正是他们之间的内在默契。有一次，一个朋友邀请福柯同布朗肖共进晚餐，被福柯婉言谢绝了：只通过读他的文章来认识他和理解他。两人刻意地不见面。但是，用布朗肖的说法，他们“都惦念着对方”。

Foucault discovered Blanchot through Sartre's article, but he soon sided with Blanchot against Sartre. If we say that Sartre was the sun of French thought in the 1960s, the hidden Blanchot was the dark night of thought. But how did the mysterious Blanchot discover Foucault? After being recommended by a publishing friend, Blanchot saw the manuscript of Foucault's unpublished doctoral dissertation "History of Madness in the Classical Age" and greatly admired this unknown young man. After the book was published, Blanchot was the first to write an ebullient review of the book. After Foucault's death in 1984, Blanchot wrote Michel Foucault as I imagined it, a comprehensive assessment of all of Foucault's important writings, his entire academic career--which he apparently continued Read and follow Foucault. Why the imaginary Michel Foucault? Just because they never met. It was a distanced friendship that never met. What is friendship at distance? Blanchot explained it this way in his book Friendship:
<br>
<br>
福柯是通过萨特的文章发现布朗肖的，但是，他很快就站在布朗肖的一边来反对萨特。如果说，萨特是六十年代法国思想界的太阳，而隐匿的布朗肖则是思想界的暗夜。但神秘的布朗肖是如何发现福柯的？经过一个出版界朋友的推荐，布朗肖看到了福柯尚未出版的博士论文《古典时代疯狂史》的手稿，就对这个默默无闻的年轻人大为赞赏。在本书出版后，布朗肖最早为这本书写了热情洋溢的评论文章。福柯1984年去世之后，布朗肖写了《我想象中的米歇尔·福柯》，对福柯的所有重要著作，对他的整个学术生涯作了全面的评价——显然，他在持续地阅读和关注福柯。为什么是想象中的米歇尔·福柯？就是因为从未谋面。这是一种从未见面的保持距离的友谊。何谓保持距离的友谊？布朗肖在他出版的《友谊》一书中作了这样的解释：
<hr>

<br>
<br>

<hr>
We must greet them in a relationship of strangers, and they greet us in that relationship, and we are like strangers to each other. Friendship, a relationship without dependencies, without a storyline, into which the simplicity of all life enters, a friendship that does so through an acknowledgment of the common unknown, so that it does not allow us to talk about our friends, we can only communicate with They talk to each other, we can't use them as the topic of our conversation (article), even in the understanding activities, they always maintain an infinite distance to us, even if the relationship is better, this distance is a fundamental separation , on this basis, the separation becomes a connection. This separation is not a refusal to talk to the confidant (how tacky it is, if only to think about it), but the distance that exists between me and the man called a friend, a pure distance that measures the distance between us relationship, this isolation keeps me from ever having the power to use him, or to use my knowledge of him (even to praise him), however, this does not prevent communication, but in this difference , and sometimes in the silence of language we came together.
<br>
<br>
我们必须以一种陌生人的关系迎接他们，他们也以这种关系迎接我们，我们之间相互形同路人。友谊，这种没有依靠、没有故事情节的关系，然而所有生命的朴实都进入其中，这种友谊以通过对共同未知的承认的方式进行，因此它不允许我们谈论我们的朋友，我们只能与他们对话，不能把他们作为我们谈话（文章）的话题，即使在理解活动之中，他们对我们言说也始终维持一种无限的距离，哪怕关系再为要好，这种距离是一种根本的分离，在这个基础上，那分离遂成为一种联系。这种分离不是拒绝交谈知心话语（这是多么俗气，哪怕只是想想），而就是存在于我和那个称为朋友的人之间的这种距离，一种纯净的距离，衡量着我们之间的关系，这种阻隔让我永远不会有权力去利用他，或者是利用我对他的认识（即便是去赞扬他），然而，这并不会阻止交流，而是在这种差异之中，有时是在语言的沉默中我们走到了一起。
<hr>

<br>
<br>

This is Blanchot's unique view of friendship. Since Aristotle, friendship has always been associated with sharing and coexistence. Friendship is about living together (Roland Barthes once devoted his one-year course at the Collège de France to this question: How to live together?). If there is no contact for a long time, the friendship will gradually die out. It is in sharing that friendship is endured and maintained: sharing good times together, enjoying each other's happiness and gospel together, and it is in this sharing that friendship is deepened. And Montaigne wasn't content to share the concept. For him, true friendship is not just sharing and mutual understanding, but a complete exchange of two souls. A true friend is exactly the same deep down, and there is no difference between the two souls combined. At this moment, there is no so-called gratitude, obligation and responsibility among friends. Because a good friend is like a person, a person is just an image of another person, and they achieve a complete overlap between them, that is, there is no distance at all. Montaigne said: "The friendship I want to talk about here is the superposition of two hearts. I have you, you have me, and they become one, and the bond that connects the two has disappeared and can no longer be identified. ." Therefore, "All that is between them, including will, thought, opinion, property, wife, children, honor, and life, is in common. They act in unison, and according to Aristotle's definition, they are one The soul occupies two bodies, so nothing can be given or received between them."
<br>
<br>
这是布朗肖独特的友谊观。自亚里士多德以来，友谊总是同分享和共存联系起来。友谊就是要共同生活（罗兰·巴特曾经在法兰西学院的一年课程中专门讨论过这个问题：如何共同生活？）。如果长时间不来往，友谊就渐趋熄灭。友谊正是在共享中得以持久和维护：共同享受美好的时光，共同享受彼此之间的快乐和福音，正是在这种分享中，友谊得以深化。而蒙田还不满足于共享这个概念。对他来说，真正的友谊不仅是分享和相互理解，而是两个人灵魂的完全交流，真正的朋友其内心深处是一模一样的，两个灵魂复合在一起毫无差异。此刻，朋友之间不存在所谓的感激、义务和责任。因为好的朋友就如同一个人，一个人不过是另外一个人的影像，他们之间达成了彻底的重叠，也就是说，完全没有距离。蒙田说：“我这里要说的友谊，则是两颗心灵叠合，我中有你，你中有我，浑然成为一体，令二者联结起来的纽带已消隐其中，再也无从辨认。”因此，“他们间所有的一切，包括意志、思想、观点、财产、妻子、儿女、荣誉和生命，都是共同拥有的。他们行动一致，依据亚里士多德的定义，他们是一个灵魂占据两个躯体，所以他们之间不能给予或得到任何东西。”
<hr>

<br>
<br>

<hr>
We see that Blanchot is a rejection of this long and deeply ingrained notion of friendship, who reverses the direction of the friendship discussion: that friendship is not infinitely close. On the contrary, friendship means not seeing each other, maintaining distance, deliberately maintaining distance and differences, and keeping silent among friends. Perhaps it is precisely because of this difference and silence that friendship is purer, and the friendship bond between friends does not become a bond, or, in other words, there is no bond between friends, and "separation becomes a connection".
<br>
<br>
我们看到，布朗肖是对这种漫长而根深蒂固的友谊观念的一个拒绝，他扭转了友谊讨论的方向：友谊不是无限地接近。相反，友谊就是不见面，就是保持距离，就是对距离和差异的刻意维护，就是朋友之间的沉默以对。或许，正是因为有这种差异和沉默，友谊才会更加纯净，朋友之间的友谊纽带不会成为羁绊，或者说，朋友之间不存在纽带，“分离遂成为一种联系”。

And Foucault also has a special feeling for the relationship between silence and friendship. In an interview, he said:
<br>

而福柯对沉默和友谊的关系也有一种特殊的感受，在一次访谈中，他说：

Some silences carry intense hostility, while others imply deep friendship, reverence, and even love. I fondly remember when producer Daniel Schmidt visited me and we had only been talking for a few minutes before somehow suddenly there was nothing to say to each other. Next we stayed from three o'clock in the afternoon until midnight. We drank, smoked heavily, and had a hearty dinner. In a full ten hours, we did not speak for more than twenty minutes. From then on, a long friendship began between us. This is the first time I have had friendship with someone in silence.
<br>
<br>
某些沉默带有强烈的敌意，另一些沉默却意味着深切的友谊、崇敬，甚至爱情。我深深地记得制片人丹尼尔·施密特造访我时的情景，我们才聊了几分钟，就不知怎地突然发现彼此间没有什么可说的了。接下来我们从下午三点钟一直待到午夜。我们喝酒，猛烈地抽烟，还吃了丰盛的晚餐。在整整十小时中，我们说的话不超过二十分钟。从那时起，我们之间开始了漫长的友谊。这是我第一次在沉默中同别人发生友情。

Perhaps this is what happened between Blanchot and Foucault: not seeing each other, keeping a pure distance, without any pollution of the world, leaving the friend in a state of absolute freedom. At the same time, pay attention to each other, comment on each other, and communicate with each other in the way of writing and reading. There is no "personal friendship" in this kind of friendship. This is what Blanchot calls an "intellectual friendship." However, this kind of friendship is never spoken out easily. This kind of friendship needs to be maintained in a silent way. The words and declarations of this kind of friendship are not an affirmation of it, but a depletion of it. A friend can be claimed only when the friend is gone forever, only when the friend never hears the name friend. It was also when Foucault could never listen that Blanchot began to declare this friendship openly: yes, Foucault was his friend. "Friendship is a gift that is promised to Foucault behind you. It goes beyond strong emotions, beyond contemplation, beyond life-threatening... I firmly believe that no matter how embarrassing the situation may be, I remain faithful to this An intellectual friendship. Foucault's death grieves me, but it allows me to declare this friendship to him today."

或许，在布朗肖和福柯之间发生的就是这类友谊：不见面，保持纯净的距离，没有世俗的任何污染，从而让朋友处在绝对的自由状态。与此同时，以写作和阅读的方式，关注对方，评论对方，和对方彼此交流。这种友谊不存在“私交”。这就是布朗肖所说的“知识友谊”。但是，这种友谊从不轻易地说出来，这种友谊需要以沉默的方式来维护，对这种友谊的言说和宣称，不是对它的肯定，而是对它的损耗。朋友，只有在朋友永远地离开的时候，只有朋友永远听不到朋友这个称呼的时候，才可以被宣称。也正是在福柯永远无法倾听的时候，布朗肖才开始公开地宣示这种友谊：是的，福柯是他的朋友。“友谊是许诺在身后赠给福柯的礼物。它超越于强烈情感之外，超越于思索问题之外，超越于生命危险之外……我坚信，不管处境多么尴尬，我仍然忠实于这一份知识友谊。福柯的逝世令我悲痛不已，但它却允许我今天向他宣示这份友谊。”

Although Foucault can no longer declare this friendship to Blanchot—two friends, one has to go first, one cannot declare friendship openly to the other—but we can still imagine Foucault agreeing Blanchot's approach. For, after the death of Roland Barthes, what Foucault expressed about friendship in his memorial speech bears a striking resemblance to what Blanchot said. It was also after Barthes's death that Foucault declared this friendship. Foucault said that Roland Barthes "has gained social recognition for more than two decades of unremitting efforts, and has produced important research results of originality, which have spared me from my friendship with him... Allow me to disclose this this afternoon." The only friendship. This friendship is at least reticently similar to the death it hates." Likewise, friendship can only be revealed after death; friendship happens only in silence; friendship is not any pragmatic tool. Isn't that what Blanchot said to the late Foucault?
<br>
<br>
尽管福柯不能向布朗肖宣称这种友谊了——两个朋友，总有一个人要先走的，总有一个人不能向另外一个人公开地宣示友谊——但是，我们仍旧可以想象福柯会认同布朗肖的做法。因为，在罗兰·巴特逝世后，福柯在他的追悼致辞中所表达的对友谊的看法，同布朗肖所说的具有惊人的相似性。也是在巴特去世后，福柯才宣示这种友谊。福柯说，罗兰·巴特“二十多年不懈的努力获得了社会的公认，并具有独创性的重要研究成果，这使我无需借助我与他的友谊……请允许我在今天下午披露这唯一的友谊。这种友谊与它所痛恨的死亡至少在寡言少语上是相似的”。同样，友谊只能在死后披露；友谊只发生在沉默寡言之中；友谊不是任何务实的工具。这不就是布朗肖对逝去的福柯所说的吗？

Blanchot ends his commemorative essay with a quote from Aristotle: "Friend, there is no friend in the world." Often, this is a curious oxymoron: how can one be called a friend? , how can you face a friend, but at the same time tell him that there are no friends in the world? But, in Blanchot, there is absolutely no paradox in this sentence: yes, Foucault is no longer a friend. So, now, I can call him my friend. This is a "no personal" friend, a silent friend, a pure "intellectual friendship".
<br>
<br>
布朗肖在他的这篇纪念文章的最后引用了亚里士多德的名言：“朋友啊，世上是没有朋友的。”通常，这是一个令人奇怪的矛盾修辞：怎么能称呼一个人为朋友，怎么能对着一个朋友的面，但同时又对他说世上根本就没有朋友呢？但是，在布朗肖这里，这句话完全没有任何的悖论：是的，世上已经没有福柯这个朋友了。所以，现在，我可以称他为我的朋友。这是“没有私交”的朋友，沉默的朋友，是纯粹的“知识友谊”。
