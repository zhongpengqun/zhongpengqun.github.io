## End of pursuit
Today i feel lost and l really lost.

I give up the pursuit to Little-Fish, because the pursuit is 
hopeless, i feel that she is not interested in me, some people say 'this is women, they never take the initiative to do anything',
i don't know.

But i want to keep the friendship with her, i like her, like her character, i hope she likes me too.

When i send out the Wechat message which i say that i decide to just keep the friendship and i will give up the pursuit,
i feel something has put down, in these weeks, i often think of her, think about our relationship, think about 
our future if we have, it makes me tired, because all these thoughts seem like is just imagination from myself.

Another cause is i think i'm not worthy of her. There are a lot of shortcomings and weaknesses in myself,
and also my job is not stable, maybe a man who is a civil servant、doctor、teacher is more suitable for her.

Anyway, there were much happy memories during these months, it makes me expect something good happen.
And we are friend, it's good.
