## 
Today is the last day of September.
Because tomorrow my 高中 classmate Fu WenTao will 举办 his wedding, and i as one of 伴郎 participate this wedding.
This night we started to do some preparations for tomorrow's wedding.
The 司仪 introduced the 流程 of wedding, the steps one by one, for example, first step, the 新娘 stand outside of the 大门,
and when music starts, 伴郎 and 伴娘 push the 大门, then 新娘 走进 大厅 and 站在新郎对面, 新郎 will sing a song for her, and 
单膝跪地求婚 then, at last, parents of 新郎 and 新娘 will 致辞 for all 参会者, and accept 新郎 and 新娘 的 敬拜.
We finished it at about 9:00 PM. 

After it, i and another best-man ZhangJie which also is my 高中 classmate decided to play basketball with other classmates, we ride my motorcycle and arrived the 篮球馆, but ultimately,
we found that the 篮球馆 has been 被拆了.
So we went to a 饭馆 to 吃烧烤.

LiYi, PengXiang, which also are our 高中 classmates went to 烧烤店 which named LuTianXia (means roll up the world) to 吃烧烤.

There was so loud in the grill, our table is at inside of the house and close to the wall, on our left, there was a table that 
2 men and 2 women sitting, their voice is so loud! But it's common in this place, this city.

We four talked about recent daily life which are no big different from what we often talked at previous dinners.

After about 20 minutes, there was a new guy came and sit at left table, looks like he was the boyfriend of the woman which 
sit against this guy.

At first 10 minutes, everything was alright.

But then at left table, the guy who is mentioned above and his girlfriend began to quarrel, the woman 摔盘子 toward to the guy.
My seat is so close to them, actually, i stand up and move away quickly after her first throwing.
She throwed about 4 盘子 toward the man, and then the man left the house.
