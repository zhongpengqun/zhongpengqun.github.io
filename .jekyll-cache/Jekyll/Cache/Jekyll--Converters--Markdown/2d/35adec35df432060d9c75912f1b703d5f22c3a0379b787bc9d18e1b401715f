What surprised me is that after playing, someone are going home, someone are still shooting on the playground, as well as the old man , i sat on the 
ground, but then old man #è½¬è¿‡èº«å­#, #èƒŒå‘# #ç¯®ç­#, moved to the #è¾¹ç•Œ# of the #ç¯®çƒåœº#, started to strip this trou</p>

<p>An busy day ends, i went off work at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>And then i rode my motorcycle to the City gym, i rode fast, about 70 KM/h.</p>

<p>Today there was nothing special, my basketball skill is not good, neither bad.</p>

<p>Sometimes even has highlight moment.</p>

<p>What one thing special was happened yesterday.</p>

<h5 id="2022-6-23">2022-6-23</h5>
<p>Today, iâ€™m a bit excited, because i finished a Merge Request.
So after work, i go to the supermarket and have bought a variety of goods.</p>

<p>And i want to have a small challenge of myself, so i bought a duck and plan to make dish â€“ beer duck.</p>

<p>Here is the detailed steps to make this dish:</p>

<h5 id="2022-6-25">2022-6-25</h5>
<p>Today is Jun 25th, yesterday i arrived in NanChang at night and then i went to my house in NanChang County.
NanChang County is a county of NanChang City.
Unfortunately, when i got home, i found the lights is unable to work, then i guessed the switch is turned off.
So i started to find where is the switch, eventually, i found it was hanged on the wall in the kitchen,
next step i brought a chair, then i standed on the chair and turned the switch on, then the lights works,
but it only works for about 10 seconds, the switch then turned off by itself, there was a problem in it.</p>

<p>It was so helpless, the temperature is so high in NanChang, but it has no way, then i spread some big papers
on the balcony as my bed.</p>

<p>Above is what happened to me at yesterday night.
And you may ask why i go to NanChang, itâ€™s because i will go to have a dinner with Little-Fish.
Today morning, i waked up at about 8 oâ€™clock, what surprised is i slept very well yesterday, maybe because i was
too tired, and i felt asleep at about 1 oâ€™clock in that night.</p>

<p>We decided to meet each other at about 6 p.m today.
Then i spent much time to clean my house, because it was too messy.
I sold the paper boxes what took up too much room, and then i picked up my express deliveries which arrived at here
during i was in XinYu in last about 3 months, there are about 10 deliveries, mainly some books.</p>

<p>Time pasted fast, when i waked up from noontime snooze, it was afternoon, i began to prepare to meet Little-Fish.
I took a bath, i washed my glasses, i shaved off my bread, i washed my shoes, 
and to dislodge the foul smell of the shoes, i poured some alcohol on tissue,
then put the tissue into the shoes.</p>

<p>Time now was 4:30, i wear clothes and shoes, and Little-Fish responseed my wechat message and send a 
address to me where we will meet, the address is a restaurant which called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">é‡æ±Ÿå—(Yu JiangNan)</code>.</p>

<p>Then i walked out, and got a taxi to carry me to the nearest subway station.
There are more than 10 stops from the start stop to the destination stop, the destination stop is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north of people's park.</code></p>

<p>I arrived at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">North of people's park</code>, the Map shows that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yu JiangNan</code> only 700 meters from me.
But i could not found it, so i got a taxi again to go to there, i arrived.
I waitting for her in front of the restaurant, and sent her a message.
She lived in a rented house nearby, she arrived here in about 8 minutes, so it was the first time i meet Little-Fish!</p>

<h2 id="todo-describe-the-sense-when-we-recognized-each-other-the-street-the-crowd-etc">TODO describe the sense when we recognized each other, the street, the crowd, etc..</h2>
<p>Recall past 2 days, i was hit by something straight, i became sensitive, maybe iâ€™m always sensitive.
I would be melancholy when she doesnâ€™t response to me in time in wechat or reject or avoid my admiration, i felt frustrated,
i still donâ€™t know her thoughts about me.</p>

<p>But then i changed my perspective after one day, we are both free, i must to be her friend firstly,
to care, to follow, to help her, this world is always hardhearted, itâ€™s even worse for a girl.
Whatever the outcome, enjoy the progress.</p>

<p>Now i saw her, we just across a narrow street, she wear a mask, glasses, a long skirt, she wear her hairs in braids.
I recognized her, so i waved to her, then she recognized me.</p>

<p>We walked along street to another restaurant which called â€˜kitchen daddyâ€™.</p>

<p>we ordered 3 dishes and then sit down, Fish removed her mask, her lip is healthy red, she smiled like a child, purity and
naturally.
We chatting while eating, we talked about old news.</p>

<h5 id="2022-6-26">2022-6-26</h5>
<p>Iâ€™m loving to write.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-8">2022-7-8</h5>
<p>M,</p>

<p>Today i feel lost and l really lost.</p>

<p>I give up the pursuit to Little-Fish, because the pursuit is 
hopeless, i feel that she is not interested in me, some people say â€˜this is women, they never take the initiative to do anythingâ€™,
i donâ€™t know.</p>

<p>But i want to keep the friendship with her, i like her, like her character, i hope she likes me too.</p>

<p>When i send out the Wechat message which i say that i decide to just keep the friendship and i will give up the pursuit,
i feel something has put down, in these weeks, i often think of her, think about our relationship, think about 
our future if we have, it makes me tired, because all these thoughts seem like is just imagination from myself.</p>

<p>Another cause is i think iâ€™m not worthy of her. There are a lot of shortcomings and weaknesses in myself,
and also my job is not stable, maybe a man who is a civil servantã€doctorã€teacher is more suitable for her.</p>

<p>Anyway, there were much happy memories during these months, it makes me expect something good happen.
And we are friend, itâ€™s good.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-9">2022-7-9</h5>
<p>I find a new enjoyable thing for me.
Reading or playing on the train.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-10">2022-7-10</h5>
<p>Itâ€™s a surprise, at about 6 p.m, Fish takes the initiative to send me a Wechat message, tells me that COVID positive re-appear in NanChang.</p>

<p>So i still have the hope, right?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Today i bought a ticket to return to XinYu, and the train will start at 8:15 p.m.
But actually, the train is late for about half hour.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-11">2022-7-11</h5>
<p>XiaoYu(å°é±¼), is her nickname, it means a little fish in english.
Actually, i have not met her so far, we chat in wechat only.
She is a doctor in a hospital of XinYu City.
From this day, i will narrate her with plain and real words.</p>

<p>Below are some fragments what we chatted on Wechat.</p>

<hr />

<p>m: Are you at work?</p>

<p>f: No, today not work.</p>

<p>m: Hmm, today i felt dizziness and chest tightness.</p>

<p>f: It might be heatstroke.</p>

<p>m: No, it rained today, not so hot.</p>

<p>f: It is common that feel dizziness and chest tightness when it rains, because the air is not good, and you will fell better after it rained.
When raining, hypoxia also happens on fishes in the pool.</p>

<p>m: I think one reason may be i was troubled by some complicate code.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-17">2022-7-17</h5>
<p>M,
â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦.
This night 1:47 A.M, so many thoughts flicker in my brain.</p>

<p>The regrets for my mistakes,</p>

<p>the confusion for my direction,</p>

<p>the expection for Fishâ€™s response,</p>

<p>the contradiction for desire,</p>

<p>the respect but doubt for noble,</p>

<p>the disappointment for self-control,</p>

<p>the impulse for criminal,</p>

<p>the distrust for anyone, include myself.</p>

<p>Everything i pursuit now i doubt itâ€™s not ture of me, just like YeGong pursuits the dragon(å¶å…¬å¥½é¾™).</p>

<p>I think what makes so sensitive and vulnerable is my cowardice,</p>

<p>but if the day cowardice inside me disappears, i guess is the day i become a terrorist.</p>

<p>I lit a cigarette just now, i have smoke for over 10 years, but not continuous in the 10 years, interrupt in some years,</p>

<p>the smell of tobacco now canâ€™t attract me, i smoke just because i feel bored,</p>

<p>the white smoke blew out from my mouth, seems telling me that my fate will always accompany me like before.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s end here, with the song â€“ Â«Â Iâ€™m your manÂ Â» from Leonard Cohen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TODO å¶å…¬å¥½é¾™</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="2022-7-20">2022-7-20</h5>
<p>M,
â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦..
Last few days, i declared the end of pursuit to Fish again.</p>

<p>The reason is same as last time.</p>

<p>I guess this time is real end.</p>

<p>Best wishes again.</p>

<p>Today is the last day of September.
Because tomorrow my #é«˜ä¸­# classmate Fu WenTao will #ä¸¾åŠ# his wedding, and i as one of #ä¼´éƒ# participate this wedding.
This night we started to do some preparations for tomorrowâ€™s wedding.
The #å¸ä»ª# introduced the #æµç¨‹# of wedding, the steps one by one, for example, first step, the #æ–°å¨˜# stand outside of the #å¤§é—¨#,
and when music starts, #ä¼´éƒ# and #ä¼´å¨˜# push the #å¤§é—¨#, then #æ–°å¨˜# walked into #å¤§å…# and #ç«™åœ¨æ–°éƒå¯¹é¢#, #æ–°éƒ# will sing a song for her, and 
#å•è†è·ªåœ°æ±‚å©š# then, at last, parents of #æ–°éƒ# and #æ–°å¨˜# will #è‡´è¾# for all #å‚ä¼šè€…#, and accept #æ–°éƒ# and #æ–°å¨˜# çš„ #æ•¬æ‹œ#.
We finished it at about 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>After it, i and another best-man ZhangJie which also is my #é«˜ä¸­# classmate decided to play basketball with other classmates, we ride my motorcycle and arrived the #ç¯®çƒé¦†#, but ultimately,
we found that the #ç¯®çƒé¦†# has been #è¢«æ‹†äº†#.
So we went to a #é¥­é¦†# to #åƒçƒ§çƒ¤#.</p>

<p>LiYi, PengXiang, which also are our #é«˜ä¸­# classmates went to #çƒ§çƒ¤åº—# which named LuTianXia (means roll up the world) to #åƒçƒ§çƒ¤#.</p>

<p>There was so loud in the grill, our table is at inside of the house and close to the wall, on our left, there was a table that 
2 men and 2 women sitting, their voice is so loud! But itâ€™s common in this place, this city.</p>

<p>We four talked about recent daily life which are no big different from what we often talked at previous dinners.</p>

<p>After about 20 minutes, there was a new guy came and sit at left table, looks like he was the boyfriend of the woman which 
sit against this guy.</p>

<p>At first 10 minutes, everything was alright.</p>

<p>But then at left table, the guy who is mentioned above and his girlfriend began to quarrel, the woman #æ‘”ç›˜å­# toward to the guy.
My seat is so close to them, actually, i stand up and move away quickly after her first throwing.
She throwed about 4 #ç›˜å­# toward the man, and then the man left the house.</p>

where i want to go, i said that i need to find a #å®¾é¦†#, then she took me to a street, and 4 or 5 #å®¾é¦†# #åœ¨è¡—è¾¹#.
I guess her job is to take passenger to this certain street and then the owner of #å®¾é¦†# pay money to her.
I reject the first #å®¾é¦†# she recommanded, because the room is so small, only a small bed in the room, and the bed almost
#å æ®äº†# the whole room, whatâ€™s worse, the height of room is so #çŸ®çš„#, not higher than 1.6 meter, i have to #å¼¯ç€è…°# to walk in the #èµ°å»Š#, such room one hundred yuan one day, so i #æœæ–­# reject it.</p>

<p>Then i found another #å®¾é¦†#, only #ç›¸éš”# 10 meters, also 100 hundred yuan one day, but much better</p>
