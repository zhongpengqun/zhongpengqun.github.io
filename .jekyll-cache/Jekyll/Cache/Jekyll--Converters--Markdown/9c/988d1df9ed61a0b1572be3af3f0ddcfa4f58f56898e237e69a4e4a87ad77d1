<p>A spectre is haunting Europe â€” the spectre of communism

<p>All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies

<hr />

<p>Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?</p>

<p>Two things result from this fact:</p>

<p>I, Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power,</p>

<p>II, It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the Spectre of Communism with a manifesto of the party itself

<p>Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes

<p>In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank

<p>In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights,plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals,guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations

<p>The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms

<p>Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinctive feature: it has simplified the class antagonisms

<hr />

<p>Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes,directly facing each other: Bourgeoisie and Proletariat
<br />

<hr />

<p>From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns, from these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed

<p>The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie

<hr />

<p>The East-Indian and Chinese markets,the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce,to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby,to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development

<hr />

<p>The feudal system of industry, under which industrial production was monopolised by closed guilds, now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets

<br />
å·¥åœºæ‰‹å·¥ä¸šä»£æ›¿äº†è¿™ç§ç»è¥æ–¹å¼</p>
<hr />

<p>The guild-masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class; division of labour between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labour in each single workshop

<p>The place of manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry, the place of the industrial middle class, by industrial millionaires, the leaders of whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois

<p>andin proportion as industry, commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital,and pushed into the background every class handed down from the MiddleAges

<p>Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and consequently, all charm for the workman

<p>The lower strata of the middle classâ€”the small tradespeople,shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasantsâ€”all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which ModernIndustry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of production

<hr />

<p>They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished statusof the workman of the Middle Ages
<br />
<br />

<hr />

<p>If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet,for a time, able to do so
<br />

<p>At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeoisie

<p>The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level

<p>Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the process of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of society, assumes such a violent, glaring character,that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands

<p>Just as, therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole

<p>The â€œdangerous class,â€ the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue

<p>In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat
