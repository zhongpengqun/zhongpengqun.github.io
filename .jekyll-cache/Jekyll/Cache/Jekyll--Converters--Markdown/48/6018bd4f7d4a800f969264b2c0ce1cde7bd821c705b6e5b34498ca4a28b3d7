<p>Helping DaJiang move house, DaJiang squattedâ€¦.æ­»æ‰©(1)å‰ƒçš„â€¦. on the ground and cried while sorting out a pile of old books</p>

<p>DaJiangâ€™s home is in a village in the countryside of Xuzhou. In his memory, his father has been working part-time near Xuzhou Railway Station, and it is rare to return home once</p>

<p>When DaJiang was admitted to a university in Xiâ€™an, his father took out a bag of money from the bank, counted each one with saliva, and counted them again and again</p>

<p>When he was a freshman, DaJiang was addicted to online games and often spent the whole night in the Internet cafes outside the school</p>

<p>Although he felt a little wasted, the classmates around him were similar, either playing football, watching movies, or playing games online. , DaJiang is relieved(æ¾äº†ä¸€å£æ°”)â€¦.ç‘åˆ©è¯¯çš„â€¦.</p>

<p>After returning home from the summer vacation, DaJiang stayed in the village for a few days and felt very bored, so he suggested to his father nervously that he wanted to go to his place to play for a few days</p>

<p>After a year of baptism(æ´—ç¤¼)â€¦.å§æ™®å‰ƒéœ‡â€¦. in college, DaJiang felt for the first time that his father was so dazzlingâ€¦.æ­è‡ªä»¤â€¦. in the crowd - the clothes were tattered(ç ´çƒ‚çš„)â€¦.å®ƒç‰¹çš„â€¦. and too large to fit</p>

<p>Father said again, the clothes are bigger, so you can stretch your hands and feet when you work, otherwise, as soon as you stretch out your hands, the clothes will be torn</p>

<p>What DaJiang did not expect was that in 2003, his father, who had a monthly income of more than 4,000 yuan, lived in the attic(é˜æ¥¼)â€¦.é˜¿æ›¿å…‹â€¦. of a private house with only six or seven square meters</p>

<p>In addition to an iron-framed bed, there is also a wooden shelf for the washbasin.

<p>DaJiang couldnâ€™t sit down, so he quietly(å®‰é™åœ°)â€¦.å¿«ç‰¹åˆ©â€¦. closed the door and went downstairs, Following behind his father, he wanted to see what his father did</p>

<h2 id="friendship-silence-language">Friendship, Silence, Language</h2>
<p>Have Foucault and Blanchot ever met? For Foucault, the answer is no. For Blanchot, the answer is yes. Foucault and Blanchot met on the campus of the Sorbonne during the May storm of 1968. On those stormy days, discussions between strangers were not abrupt. Blanchot recognized the already famous Foucault and spoke to him a few words. However, Foucault did not know that the person speaking to him was his idol Blanchot. Despite his stellar reputation, Blanchot hardly made a public appearance after World War II. He was present only by means of writing. Apart from his writings, nothing is known about him. It was only during the May storm that he appeared in public for the only time in an anonymous capacity. Of course Foucault would not recognize him. Blanchot does not give interviews to reporters, does not reveal his photos, does not participate in academic conferences, and rarely even meets his friends (including his best friend Levinas). The way he communicates with friends is to write continuously letter. He lived a life of seclusion and isolation, and as he has repeatedly expressed in his books, he endowed silence, loneliness and distance with a unique value. Instead of talking to people face to face, Blanchot takes the Nietzschean way, talking passionately to himself, a loner talking to his shadow. He often asks and answers himself in the book, having â€œinfinite conversationsâ€ with himself. Until his death in 2003, it was unclear whether the man known as Franceâ€™s most famous disappearance of the twentieth century was still alive.

<p>In the sixties, Foucault read a great deal of Blanchot. Blanchot became one of Foucaultâ€™s most obsessive authors. Foucault has repeatedly and unabashedly expressed his homage to Blanchot on various occasions. He once told his friends that when he was young, he dreamed of being Blanchot. He quoted Blanchot a lot in the text. Following Blanchotâ€™s style, the self-questioning and self-answering method he adopted in the back of â€œThe Archeology of Knowledgeâ€ is an imitation and tribute to Blanchot. Blanchot, Bataille and Krosovsky, the three philosophers and writers at the same time, were also the three authors that Foucault was obsessed with in the 1950s and 1960s. It was they who decisively led Foucault to Nietzsche. â€œFor me, Nietzsche, Bataille, Blanchot, Krosovsky are escapes from philosophy. Batailleâ€™s rage, Blanchotâ€™s tantalizing and annoying sweetness, Krosovskyâ€™s Spirals, these are all starting from philosophy, bringing philosophy into play and questioning, out of philosophy, and back into philosophy.â€ They both break down the line between philosophy and non-philosophy - which is also Foucaultâ€™s style . However, he did not associate with them. He only met Krosovsky on the recommendation of Roland Barthes and suggested a solid friendship. While Bataille died prematurely in 1962, Blanchot, a recluse, was never seen. For Foucault, too, he was willing to maintain the mystical cult of Blanchot. Perhaps, keeping a distance is the inner tacit understanding between them. Once, a friend invited Foucault to dinner with Blanchot, but Foucault politely declined: to know him and understand him only by reading his articles. The two deliberately did not meet. But, in Blanchotâ€™s words, they â€œboth miss each otherâ€.

<p>Foucault discovered Blanchot through Sartreâ€™s article, but he soon sided with Blanchot against Sartre. If we say that Sartre was the sun of French thought in the 1960s, the hidden Blanchot was the dark night of thought. But how did the mysterious Blanchot discover Foucault? After being recommended by a publishing friend, Blanchot saw the manuscript of Foucaultâ€™s unpublished doctoral dissertation â€œHistory of Madness in the Classical Ageâ€ and greatly admired this unknown young man. After the book was published, Blanchot was the first to write an ebullient review of the book. After Foucaultâ€™s death in 1984, Blanchot wrote Michel Foucault as I imagined it, a comprehensive assessment of all of Foucaultâ€™s important writings, his entire academic careerâ€“which he apparently continued Read and follow Foucault. Why the imaginary Michel Foucault? Just because they never met. It was a distanced friendship that never met. What is friendship at distance? Blanchot explained it this way in his book Friendship:

<p>We must greet them in a relationship of strangers, and they greet us in that relationship, and we are like strangers to each other. Friendship, a relationship without dependencies, without a storyline, into which the simplicity of all life enters, a friendship that does so through an acknowledgment of the common unknown, so that it does not allow us to talk about our friends, we can only communicate with They talk to each other, we canâ€™t use them as the topic of our conversation (article), even in the understanding activities, they always maintain an infinite distance to us, even if the relationship is better, this distance is a fundamental separation , on this basis, the separation becomes a connection. This separation is not a refusal to talk to the confidant (how tacky it is, if only to think about it), but the distance that exists between me and the man called a friend, a pure distance that measures the distance between us relationship, this isolation keeps me from ever having the power to use him, or to use my knowledge of him (even to praise him), however, this does not prevent communication, but in this difference , and sometimes in the silence of language we came together.

<p>This is Blanchotâ€™s unique view of friendship. Since Aristotle, friendship has always been associated with sharing and coexistence. Friendship is about living together (Roland Barthes once devoted his one-year course at the CollÃ¨ge de France to this question: How to live together?). If there is no contact for a long time, the friendship will gradually die out. It is in sharing that friendship is endured and maintained: sharing good times together, enjoying each otherâ€™s happiness and gospel together, and it is in this sharing that friendship is deepened. And Montaigne wasnâ€™t content to share the concept. For him, true friendship is not just sharing and mutual understanding, but a complete exchange of two souls. A true friend is exactly the same deep down, and there is no difference between the two souls combined. At this moment, there is no so-called gratitude, obligation and responsibility among friends. Because a good friend is like a person, a person is just an image of another person, and they achieve a complete overlap between them, that is, there is no distance at all. Montaigne said: â€œThe friendship I want to talk about here is the superposition of two hearts. I have you, you have me, and they become one, and the bond that connects the two has disappeared and can no longer be identified. .â€ Therefore, â€œAll that is between them, including will, thought, opinion, property, wife, children, honor, and life, is in common. They act in unison, and according to Aristotleâ€™s definition, they are one The soul occupies two bodies, so nothing can be given or received between them.â€

<p>We see that Blanchot is a rejection of this long and deeply ingrained notion of friendship, who reverses the direction of the friendship discussion: that friendship is not infinitely close. On the contrary, friendship means not seeing each other, maintaining distance, deliberately maintaining distance and differences, and keeping silent among friends. Perhaps it is precisely because of this difference and silence that friendship is purer, and the friendship bond between friends does not become a bond, or, in other words, there is no bond between friends, and â€œseparation becomes a connectionâ€.

<p>And Foucault also has a special feeling for the relationship between silence and friendship. In an interview, he said:

<p>Some silences carry intense hostility, while others imply deep friendship, reverence, and even love. I fondly remember when producer Daniel Schmidt visited me and we had only been talking for a few minutes before somehow suddenly there was nothing to say to each other. Next we stayed from three oâ€™clock in the afternoon until midnight. We drank, smoked heavily, and had a hearty dinner. In a full ten hours, we did not speak for more than twenty minutes. From then on, a long friendship began between us. This is the first time I have had friendship with someone in silence.

<p>Perhaps this is what happened between Blanchot and Foucault: not seeing each other, keeping a pure distance, without any pollution of the world, leaving the friend in a state of absolute freedom. At the same time, pay attention to each other, comment on each other, and communicate with each other in the way of writing and reading. There is no â€œpersonal friendshipâ€ in this kind of friendship. This is what Blanchot calls an â€œintellectual friendship.â€ However, this kind of friendship is never spoken out easily. This kind of friendship needs to be maintained in a silent way. The words and declarations of this kind of friendship are not an affirmation of it, but a depletion of it. A friend can be claimed only when the friend is gone forever, only when the friend never hears the name friend. It was also when Foucault could never listen that Blanchot began to declare this friendship openly: yes, Foucault was his friend. â€œFriendship is a gift that is promised to Foucault behind you. It goes beyond strong emotions, beyond contemplation, beyond life-threateningâ€¦ I firmly believe that no matter how embarrassing the situation may be, I remain faithful to this An intellectual friendship. Foucaultâ€™s death grieves me, but it allows me to declare this friendship to him today.â€

<p>Although Foucault can no longer declare this friendship to Blanchotâ€”two friends, one has to go first, one cannot declare friendship openly to the otherâ€”but we can still imagine Foucault agreeing Blanchotâ€™s approach. For, after the death of Roland Barthes, what Foucault expressed about friendship in his memorial speech bears a striking resemblance to what Blanchot said. It was also after Barthesâ€™s death that Foucault declared this friendship. Foucault said that Roland Barthes â€œhas gained social recognition for more than two decades of unremitting efforts, and has produced important research results of originality, which have spared me from my friendship with himâ€¦ Allow me to disclose this this afternoon.â€ The only friendship. This friendship is at least reticently similar to the death it hates.â€ Likewise, friendship can only be revealed after death; friendship happens only in silence; friendship is not any pragmatic tool. Isnâ€™t that what Blanchot said to the late Foucault?

<p>Blanchot ends his commemorative essay with a quote from Aristotle: â€œFriend, there is no friend in the world.â€ Often, this is a curious oxymoron: how can one be called a friend? , how can you face a friend, but at the same time tell him that there are no friends in the world? But, in Blanchot, there is absolutely no paradox in this sentence: yes, Foucault is no longer a friend. So, now, I can call him my friend. This is a â€œno personalâ€ friend, a silent friend, a pure â€œintellectual friendshipâ€.
