Today is the last day of September.
Because tomorrow my é«˜ä¸­ classmate Fu WenTao will ä¸¾åŠ his wedding, and i as one of ä¼´éƒ participate this wedding.
This night we started to do some preparations for tomorrowâ€™s wedding.
The å¸ä»ª introduced the æµç¨‹ of wedding, the steps one by one, for example, first step, the æ–°å¨˜ stand outside of the å¤§é—¨,
and when music starts, ä¼´éƒ and ä¼´å¨˜ push the å¤§é—¨, then æ–°å¨˜ èµ°è¿› å¤§å… and ç«™åœ¨æ–°éƒå¯¹é¢, æ–°éƒ will sing a song for her, and 
å•è†è·ªåœ°æ±‚å©š then, at last, parents of æ–°éƒ and æ–°å¨˜ will è‡´è¾ for all å‚ä¼šè€…, and accept æ–°éƒ and æ–°å¨˜ çš„ æ•¬æ‹œ.
We finished it at about 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>After it, i and another best-man ZhangJie which also is my é«˜ä¸­ classmate decided to play basketball with other classmates, we ride my motorcycle and arrived the ç¯®çƒé¦†, but ultimately,
we found that the ç¯®çƒé¦† has been è¢«æ‹†äº†.
So we went to a é¥­é¦† to åƒçƒ§çƒ¤.</p>

<p>LiYi, PengXiang, which also are our é«˜ä¸­ classmates went to çƒ§çƒ¤åº— which named LuTianXia (means roll up the world) to åƒçƒ§çƒ¤.</p>

<p>There was so loud in the grill, our table is at inside of the house and close to the wall, on our left, there was a table that 
2 men and 2 women sitting, their voice is so loud! But itâ€™s common in this place, this city.</p>

<p>We four talked about recent daily life which are no big different from what we often talked at previous dinners.</p>

<p>After about 20 minutes, there was a new guy came and sit at left table, looks like he was the boyfriend of the woman which 
sit against this guy.</p>

<p>At first 10 minutes, everything was alright.</p>

<p>But then at left table, the guy who is mentioned above and his girlfriend began to quarrel, the woman æ‘”ç›˜å­ toward to the guy.
My seat is so close to them, actually, i stand up and move away quickly after her first throwing.
She throwed about 4 ç›˜å­ toward the man, and then the man left the house.</p>
