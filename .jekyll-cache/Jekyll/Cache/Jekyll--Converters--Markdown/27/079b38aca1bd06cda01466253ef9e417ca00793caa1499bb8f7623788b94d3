<p>XiaoYu(小鱼), is her nickname, it means a little fish in english.
Actually, i have not met her so far, we chat in wechat only.
She is a doctor in a hospital of XinYu City.
From this day, i will narrate her with plain and real words.</p>

<p>Below are some fragments what we chatted on Wechat.</p>

<hr />

<p>me: m      fish: f</p>

<p>m: Are you at work?</p>

<p>f: No, today not work.</p>

<p>m: Hmm, today i felt dizziness and chest tightness.</p>

<p>f: It might be heatstroke.</p>

<p>m: No, it rained today, not so hot.</p>

<p>f: It is common that feel dizziness and chest tightness when it rains, because the air is not good, and you will fell better after it rained.
When raining, hypoxia also happens on fishes in the pool.</p>

<p>m: I think one reason may be i was troubled by some complicate code.</p>
