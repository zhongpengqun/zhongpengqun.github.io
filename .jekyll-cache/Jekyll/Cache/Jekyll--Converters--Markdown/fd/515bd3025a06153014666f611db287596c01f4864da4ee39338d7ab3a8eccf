<p>This night 1:47 A.M, so many thoughts flicker in my brain.</p>

<p>The regrets for my mistakes,</p>

<p>the confusion for my direction,</p>

<p>the expection for Fishâ€™s response,</p>

<p>the contradiction for desire,</p>

<p>the respect but doubt for noble,</p>

<p>the disappointment for self-control,</p>

<p>the impulse for criminal,</p>

<p>the distrust for anyone, include myself.</p>

<p>Everything i pursuit now i doubt itâ€™s not ture of me, just like YeGong pursuits the dragon(å¶å…¬å¥½é¾™).</p>

<p>I think what makes so sensitive and vulnerable is my cowardice,</p>

<p>but if the day cowardice inside me disappears, i guess is the day i become a terrorist.</p>

<p>I lit a cigarette just now, i have smoke for over 10 years, but not continuous in the 10 years, interrupt in some years,</p>

<p>the smell of tobacco now canâ€™t attract me, i smoke just because i feel bored,</p>

<p>the white smoke blew out from my mouth, seems telling me that my fate will always accompany me like before.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s end here, with the song â€“ Â«Â Iâ€™m your manÂ Â» from Leonard Cohen.</p>
