## Mark

## Restart
This night 1:47 A.M, so many thoughts flicker in my brain.

The regrets for my mistakes, 

the confusion for my direction, 

the expection for Fish's response,

the contradiction for desire, 

the respect but doubt for noble,

the disappointment for self-control,

the impulse for criminal,

the distrust for anyone, include myself.

Everything i pursuit now i doubt it's not ture of me, just like YeGong pursuits the dragon(叶公好龙).

I think what makes so sensitive and vulnerable is my cowardice,

but if the day cowardice inside me disappears, i guess is the day i become a terrorist.

I lit a cigarette just now, i have smoke for over 10 years, but not continuous in the 10 years, interrupt in some years,

the smell of tobacco now can't attract me, i smoke just because i feel bored,

the white smoke blew out from my mouth, seems telling me that my fate will always accompany me like before.

Let's end here, with the song -- << I'm your man >> from Leonard Cohen.
