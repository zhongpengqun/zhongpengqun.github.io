(sighs)

- My name's Gummo, I'm a hacker.

I've been a hacker for the past 36 years.

And I'm here to tell my story.

My story started pretty young, right?

I was born and <font color="red">raised in</font>
Jacksonville, Florida.

Grew up absolutely <font color="red">dirt poor</font>

and I had an older brother.

I had two older brothers,

one half brother and a natural sibling.

And all of us grew up in Jacksonville.

Growing up in Jacksonville,

we only had a mom, our mother.

She raised us by herself,

all three of us, the best that she could.

She was an <font color="red">alcoholic</font>

and she did the best raising three boys.

My mom passed away when I
was 12-years-old in 1985.

And I actually actually woke
up on December 7, 1985 and...

pulled the covers back
and there was my mom.

And so ever since then,
I've been on my own.

My brother and I, we went
to go live with my aunt

but she failed at that miserably.

And my father was <font color="red">in prison</font>.

So there was no choice really

but to live with friends of the family,

which we did for a little while.

And my brother,

he was about a year and
a half older than me,

so <font color="red">he was much more of a free spirit</font>.

He just went on his way.

Went on to do his thing at 16-years-old.

By that time, I'm <font color="red">14 and a
half</font> and really on my own.

And that's when I
discovered computers, right?

Actually I discovered computers
about three years earlier

before my mother passed away.

Never really <font color="red">gave any
consideration</font> to it other than

any other normal kid at the
age of eight, nine, ten.

So it sat until my mother passed away.

And before she passed away,

the night actually that she passed away,

she had come home from graduation

of my brother, my
half-brother had graduated

basic training at Fort Benning.

And the thing she told me
before she went to bed was

she asked me how my computer
studies were coming along

and <font color="red">I lied to her</font>, right?

And I said, they were going great.

<font color="red">In actuality</font>, I really
wasn't doing anything.

Then she passed, right?

You deal with what you can deal with

when you're 12, 13-years-old.

And my <font color="red">outlet</font> was computers.

First, I <font color="red">withdrew</font> like any other kid does.

I guess, I don't know.

And <font color="red">second of all</font>, I began
to master my computer.

I had a TRS-80 Model II

and I taught myself how
to code, code basic.

And for a couple years,
that's where I was, right?

When people would ask me if I
was fine, yeah, I'm fine, yeah

but my grades were really <font color="red">disastrous</font>.

<font color="red">I had a couple friends
that I really engaged with</font>,

<font color="red">but no one too in particular</font>,

but I did <font color="red">withdraw</font> even more
into my computer, right?

I got an <font color="red">acoustic</font> modem,

connected that to <font color="red">a local bulletin board</font>,

and began to meet other people,

began to meet other people like me.

And then people ask about you, right?

They wanna know who you are.

<font color="red">Back then</font>, the internet

really wasn't what people think it is now.

It was <font color="red">more or less dial up boards</font>,

ARPANET, closed loop
systems, <font color="red">things of that such</font>.

But I set up a bulletin
board on a local BBS system

and at the <font color="red">ripe</font> old age of 14,

I started to meet other hackers online.

And I started to learn
a lot of cool things

like <font color="red">telephone phreaking</font>, like
how to make free phone calls.

I discovered a subculture
of people who existed

on the phone lines, on the telephone lines

where they were, you could talk to someone

in London or in Paris or in Georgia or LA.

And you can meet these
people on the telephone

on these telephone
party line, so to speak.

14-years-old, I'm learning how
to phreak telephone systems.

Phreaking telephone systems
was a way to actually access

the old telephone systems,
the old bell systems

with special instructions
and codes and methods,

which have long since expired

since the telephone
system has <font color="red">gone digital</font>.

So 14-years-old, I'm
learning how to code myself.

I've set up a bulletin board,

I'm meeting hackers
and I'm <font color="red">getting advice</font>.

I'm learning how to do things.

I'm learning how to get the
things that I need, right?

Because I'm living with
friends of the family

and they really...

They too themselves were
<font color="red">barely able to support me</font>,

much barely themselves as well.

So everything that I had to
do was for myself, right?

Everything.

From food, to money,

for money for clothes,
for school, everything.

My entire existence depended
on my willingness to make sure

that I was taking care of myself.

And so that's what I learned how to do.

I learned how to, at
the age of 15-years-old,

I took a Bell &amp; Howell Language Master

and I learned how to
reprogram credit cards

to use them in stores and in ATMs

back before ATMs really
had a <font color="red">dedicated</font> ATM line

to verify a transaction.

And of course, I would understand

the batching process and all that.

But that was 32 years ago.

And I just learned how
to <font color="red">manipulate</font> things

to get the things that I wanted,

whether it was printing
a UPC code for food

from the store which I needed or doing

the <font color="red">magnetic</font> gas handle flip.

Back in those days, when
you need a gas for your car,

there was a dial on the gas pump

and you would <font color="red">flip the dial on and off</font>.

Well, if you took an
<font color="red">old-fashioned</font> speaker magnet

and <font color="red">set it next to the handle</font>,

that would <font color="red">flip it up and engage the pump</font>.

The pump would begin to run
to distribute gas in the <font color="red">hose</font>

but the numbers wouldn't turn.

So I kept learning these tricks, right?

I kept learning little tricks to survive,

survivability tricks, learning
how to social engineer people

to get what I wanted,

whether it was access
to a specific computer

that I wanted to dial in
to steal some files from,

or whether or not it was to
<font color="red">convince the supermarket manager</font>

that I had left some food behind,

when in turn I actually hadn't,

just so I could eat that night.

So just growing up,

meeting hackers online,

people giving me what I felt
like was worthwhile advice

to survive, to be able to not
wind up in a bad situation.

And that's exactly how I kept
myself from falling apart,

from going under.

And all of the wild, right?

I'm still living with
friends of the family.

1989 comes around.

I'm 16, 17 years old.

The friends of the family
really had enough of me

living there, so the official
parting of ways, right?

So there I am, I just turned
17-years-old and I'm on my own.

I had a Chevrolet Chevette,
a 1984 Chevrolet Chevette,

no, a 1982 Chevrolet
Chevette, powder blue,

and all of my stuff was in there,

including my TRS-80 Model II.

And I lived in my car

for the better part of
the entire year of 1989.

And it was tough, right?

I dropped out of school.

I began to lose focus.

I began stealing cars,
began using my skills

in very, very unique fashions
to obtain money quickly

because when you're living in your car,

what choice do you have?

So, yeah, I did that for about a year.

Then I met a girl and
she became my girlfriend.

And ultimately she became my
wife and she helped me realize

what I was capable

of doing and her family took me in and...

I went and got a job just
bagging groceries and shit and...

just kept doing that, right?

Someone believing in me.

And still sticking to computers.

Had a daughter.

My daughter who turns 30 this December.

My wife and I had a daughter.

And I realized that I needed to do better,

needed to do more, provide more
for my wife and my daughter.

And so there I am, bagging groceries,

working in retail stores
and actually working hard

and continuing my computer studies,

teaching myself C, COBOL,
FORTRAN, all of the old languages,

teaching myself computer languages

and taking care of a wife
and a kid on $5 an hour,

and I kept doing that.

And about two years into that,

I got the opportunity, I
saved up enough money to go

to the Chaos Congress in Germany,

which is an annual conference of hackers

from all around the world.

And I met some hackers like me

who had not only been through a struggle,

but were continuing to
go through a struggle.

I met a friend of mine, his
name was Boris Floricic.

He went by the hacker name Tron

and we became really good friends.

And Boris and I,

we worked on a lot of smart
card systems together.

He taught me about smart
cards, the little chip card

in your wallet that
everyone carries around,

that thing what's in your wallet.

And at the time, no one really
knew what smart cards were.

They were only used extensively
in Europe at the time.

And so Boris taught me about smart cards,

these things that have a computer,
a microprocessor in them.

And he taught me that these
things control many things,

from television access,
to telephone access,

to making and receiving
long-distance calls.

And so we worked on a
crypto card scheme together

to where we were able to
actually reverse engineer

about five different providers
who issued chip cards,

smart cards for their services.

We successfully decrypted those services.

And with that knowledge,

after we became friends,
after a couple years,

we began to converse back and forth.

At that point, this is '94.

And now I'm attending the
CAS Congress each year

and meeting with Boris and
we're chatting back and forth

on all kinds of technology,
most specifically smart cards.

About that time here in the United States,

Hughes Space systems was ready to launch

a system called DirecTV.

Back then actually it was called DSS,

the Digital Satellite System.

And Hughes built the
system from the ground up.

And I was interested in that.

The reason I was interested in that

because at this point, it's 1995,

my father has just been
released from prison.

And so I go to visit him and
he's watching television.

I said, "Oh, dad, what is that?"

And he's like, "Oh, it's a
satellite system called DirecTV."

And I was amazed by the picture quality

and how great it looked.

And it all came on a
little small 18-inch dish.

So that was pretty fascinating.

And I looked at the
system and I'd realized

it was controlled, all
of the authorizations

were controlled by, you
guessed it, a smart card.

So it really took very little to no effort

between Boris and I to
collaborate on the DirecTV F card,

which basically was a smart
card that allowed authorization

for customers to receive HBO,
all of the channels, right?

Pay-per-views, et cetera.

And we successfully created
a quite little humble system

to reprogram those cards
and laughed it off.

Really didn't think anything
of the wares after that.

And then several months past, right?

Busy couple of years,

I'm going to school and actually working

at a carpet cleaning company.

And really just surviving,
paying the bills

and continuing to enhance my skills.

And I'm like, well, you
know, the hell with it,

you know, I really need some more money.

My daughter's getting
ready to go into school.

And so I wanted to put her into a school.

And so I decided to sell
my wares for programming

DirecTV satellite access cards.

And so that's what I did.

I realized that it was
very easy to make money

providing a service for people

who did not wish to pay their bill.

I really wanted to one up my game, right?

So Boris and I, we worked
together on some extensible ideas

and we created some software
that we sold to the Canadians,

and we made some money, right?

We made $10 million each

and I was able to get
everything that I wanted,

and so did Boris.

And it was great, but there
were a lot more factors

than just Boris and I releasing code.

There were other mitigating factors.

You had an entire battalion of
hackers from Rupert Murdochs

and trying to actually circumvent

other services and competitors
out there to destroy them,

which they ultimately did, but
that's a whole other story.

So we hacked DirecTV for a few years

and made some money, got caught.

And then after I got caught,

I was offered an opportunity, right?

Rather than to go and sit
in prison for a long time,

I was asked to consult
and helping a company

at that time called NDS

to help them solve their
conditional access problem,

which at that point,

the entire DirecTV system
was completely compromised

and NDS was looking for a
way to stamp out piracy.

So consulted with some
good minds in Haifa, Israel

for a couple years, and went on my way.

Came back to Jacksonville
after hanging out consulting,

securing the DirecTV period 4 card,

helping a lot with that technology.

Moving on, coming back home,

my name sort of floated
out in the wrong direction.

This guy who was doing the DirecTV cards,

his wife was a dispatcher,

she obtained my information
and then my wife's information

and then my family's information

and pretty much doxed me at that point.

And back then, doxing someone
was really a terrifying thing,

such it as now, right?

When someone doxes you

or post your information on the internet.

It's a shitty thing to go through.

And in my circumstance, I had

a lot more things that I was involved with

with the government, so...

With a lot of help from the government

and my own my
self-motivation now, I moved.

I moved to Indiana.

Packed up the kids, packed
everything, and moved to Indiana.

I was just gonna really
kind of lay low for a while.

I just got back from Israel,

I moved from Florida to Indiana,

and really just kind of chilled out.

I got a job at a newspaper

and handled their websites
and all of that, real low key,

low tech job, nothing fancy,

living in the middle of
a cornfield, so to speak

and enjoyed it, enjoyed the
life for a couple of years.

And then I was asked to...

And then a gentleman I met in Indiana

invited me up to Chicago to
take a look at his business,

to see what sort of technical advice

I could give him for his business.

And so I traveled to Chicago,

got to know him within several days.

He got to know who I really
was about my background.

And I went to work for him.

And at this point, right,

now I have a job and I'm doing,

I'm setting up IT
infrastructure for his company

and making sure that all
of his offices connect.

And not only that, but securely, right?

Cyber security really wasn't a thing then.

It was barely even mentioned.

But cybersecurity to me,
right, to what exists now,

or what people realize
as cyber security now,

to me is just an afterthought
or was an afterthought.

Still sort of is mentally speaking

because things that people
are writing papers about,

talking about, creating solutions about,

these are all things that
are built on technologies

that were built when the
internet was created, right?

Everybody's talking about 1970s technology

and no one's really
trying to fix the problem.

But yeah, so I provided
cybersecurity for him, his company.

Set up the whole deal.

And then just started meeting new friends

along the way in Chicago.

That's how it is in Chicago.

And one thing led to another.

Met a gentleman named Willard Harper,

Willard Buddy Harper.

And he worked at the CME in Chicago.

He was one of the largest hog
traders in the world really.

And he gave me an opportunity to create

some special networks for the
CME to connect to the NYSE.

And so with that, after
doing several of those,

meaning, they were really simple for me,

but I created some ultra
high speed private networks

that only the CME and the NYSE still use.

And so he was impressed with that

and he's like, "What else can you do?"

And I'm like-
- Just so people know this,

Chicago Mercantile Exchange

and the New York Stock Exchange.

- That is correct, yes, yeah.

So I set up two bi-directional
unique fiber lines

specifically for those two
exchanges and secured them.

So yeah, he asked me what was next.

So I'm like, "Hey, there's
this thing called Bitcoin.

"It kinda piques my interest."

And he asked me what I needed.

I said, "About a million
bucks would work."

And he literally opened up a file cabinet,

he had a million dollars in.

He's like, "All right, go do it."

And that's what I did.

At that point, I built a supercomputer

that was able to mine Bitcoin.

I mined about 5,000 Bitcoin.

And at that point, I
believe Bitcoin was trading

at $200 to $300 a coin.

And so he was impressed
and so was I actually.

And so we built three more
over the next eight months.

I built three more and
had them right there

at 107 West Van Buren
Street across from the CME

and just sucking up electricity.

But at the end of that
year and a half run,

we were able to mine
close to 80,000 Bitcoin.

So yeah,

after a couple of years of doing that,

I really felt a little
sense of accomplishment,

but I really didn't feel like I was done.

So I ran into a gentleman... (laughs)

So I'm squandering around Chicago, right?

I've mined some Bitcoin, I'm hanging out,

walking around the loop,
hanging out in Millennial Park

and just hanging out with my friends.

And kicking back, I met
a gentlemen and he said,

hey, you know, our company
needs a webmaster, right?

And a webmaster is just basically someone

who just does web work for a company.

I'm like okay, yeah, sure.

Yeah, I'll come and be
your webmaster, right?

Because having a job,
having a legitimate job

completes who I am, right?

I could sit around and do
whatever I want to make money,

but in the end, I think it's about working

in honest nine to five.

And so, yeah.

Yeah, hey Jackson, I'll go and work,

be a webmaster at your software company.

And so I went to work
there as their webmaster

and it was hilarious, right?

They're vice presidents.

They're like, "Well, this
is a very important job

"and you should blah, blah, blah."

And I'm, yes, sir and yes, ma'am.

I really kept the ruse
up as long as I could

but I was outed by a friend
of mine that worked there

and he outed me to the marketing manager

and the marketing manager,

she outed me to the entire staff

and eventually I became responsible

for their cybersecurity practice.

And so I'm like, well, shit,

I guess I'm doing cybersecurity.

So here I am doing cybersecurity

for a software company in
Chicago, unintended, right?

But I'm honing my skills, right?

Figuring out the best method

to stand up specific protocols and systems

and things of that nature from
a cybersecurity perspective.

And so that's what I did.

I did it pretty well.

But then they fired me.

Then they just, they fired me.

And so, yeah, it was kind of a thing

between the owner and myself.

He didn't like me and I
surely didn't like him.

So now that that's public,
I really didn't like him.

So after that, right, I
just took a couple of gigs

as cybersecurity, just kind of...

just did my thing, packed
up my stuff the entire time

in Chicago and came back to Jacksonville.

And again, doing consulting
with a company for cybersecurity

and I enjoy it.

But that's what led me
to where I am now, right?

From some of those angles.

I've been responsible for
putting some heavy hitters away.

I've worked with law
enforcement in the past,

some real heavy hitters.

I'm really good at hunting
hackers and finding people

and finding, not finding just people,

but finding the real hacker, right?

The real hacker that's
really causing mayhem.

I'm that guy that looks for that hacker.

And I do that very seriously
and continue to do that

because I provide my service
not only for companies, right,

but for celebrities and stars, right?

They consult with me.

I work with them personally

to solve any cybersecurity questions

or issues that they have.

Some of the things that
people don't understand is

that everyone carries around a smartphone,

watching Edward Snowden do
all of this ridiculousness,

hiding under covers and everything.

Everyone should know that
your smartphone is a PC,

is a portable computer,

and the things that that smart
phones are capable of doing

are very terrifying.

There just recently was
an exploit that I had used

for years for iOS that
allowed me to actually listen

in on your phone conversations,
to read your SMS messages,

to read your email, to actually
see everything that you do

on your iOS device.

Those sort of exploits exists
everywhere in everything.

Almost everything has a GPS chip in it.

Almost every device has a chip in it.

And if it has a chip in
it, it can be exploited.

And when things are exploited,

sometimes devices things,
systems and people

are exploited for one reason or another.

There's a lot of things that
are very scary out there.

Right now there are people
selling your information.

They're selling your wifi network.

They're selling your wifi credentials.

They're selling your
ancestry.com genealogy data.

They're selling all of that.

The thing that people
don't really understand is

that there really is no
more privacy in this world,

unless you go and live on an island

somewhere in the South
Pacific with no electricity

and no other people,

there are things to be taken advantage of

and systems and devices and so on.

It takes a professional car thief

about 30 seconds to steal a car now,

because you really don't
need to hotwire anything

or use a screwdriver or even a laptop.

You can use an RF intercept
or intercepting device

which could do a man in
the middle of the attack

with just a key fob and you can steal

someone's $150,000 car with that.

The technology stacks
out there are endless

that are being taken advantage of.

Most notably are the cellular
systems, the mobile systems,

what people carry around most

contain the most value and the most data.

Putting your information on TikTok,

creating a TikTok account

and filming from so many locations.

You don't realize what you're really doing

is you're really giving
everything that you hold,

possessive in private out to the world.

And that's where we see
people being attacked.

People, their bank accounts
being compromised, et cetera.

Speaking of bank accounts,
a lot of people realize

that when you log into your bank,

and a lot of banks will really deny this,

but banks actually have back
doors into your accounts,

into your system.

Just think about it for a moment.

When you log into your bank accounts

through suchandsuch.com

and you have to answer all
of these ridiculous questions

and get a two-factor
SMS message sent to you,

so you can enter in the code.

But people really don't realize is

that their banks also have backdoor access

to where applications like your TurboTax

and your money management
software, all of that.

How do you think that
connects to your banks?

And so with these backdoor
connections into banks

things continue to be inherently insecure.

We see data breaches every day

where millions of people have
their information stolen.

And not only stolen, but
sold and used against them.

One of the things that
we also have to realize

is that we have quantum computers coming.

Quantum computers will make all current

and former encryption
algorithms absolutely obsolete.

So if you have something that
you've encrypted in the past

or you have some encrypted files

and they've been anywhere on the internet,

in a book, wherever,

someone else can access
your encrypted files.

Well, very soon those files
won't remain encrypted long.

And so hopefully, those secrets
were quite well encrypted.

Websites.

Websites have so many flaws in them.

Everybody needs a website nowadays.

Everybody has a website to go
to, their favorite website.

(sighs)

Right now, about 90% of the
web and the technologies

that support them in your
applications in websites

they're insecure, they're
inherently insecure.

Whether or not it's a web
server running an open port

or a misconfigure file on your server.

There's something that...

There's a little bit of
something out there for everyone

to take advantage of and now
everyone is paying the price.

Everyone now is becoming
victims to these crimes

to where they thought
they weren't a victim,

where they never thought
they would actually be

potentially be a victim.

The more mobile applications,

the more people that are using
the phones that we just...

The more people that use mobile devices

require more mobile applications,

require more data centers,

require more servers for those
applications to connect to.

And those are all at risk.

All you have to do is do a DNS
query on anyone's web domain

and you can begin to uncover the pieces

of how insecure most
organizations and individuals are.

People don't realize that
when they're at home,

they put a password on their router

and they think that's it.

I'm safe, I'm secure.

But no one really understands the context

of using an additional layer
of protection, like a VPN

or some sort of ad blocking technology.

And people don't realize
that their IP address

is basically like a flag
out there on the internet

for them to be discovered,
for them to be stalked,

harassed, intimidated, swatted.

It doesn't matter.

And so it all comes with
understanding these technologies

and understanding how to protect ourselves

and how to protect
yourself against bad people

wearing hoodies and cloaks.

As I said, not all hackers are bad people.

Most hackers...

Everyone is a hacker.

If it weren't for hackers,
we would not have wifi.

We wouldn't have cameras.

We wouldn't have many things
that we take for granted today.

Criminals are the ones that
give hackers bad names.

Criminals are the ones who
are breaking into systems

and stealing information
and creating data breaches.

Criminals are the ones
who are stalking people

and bad context and stealing from others

who don't belong, not hackers.

And so it's been said before

and here I am saying it too, right?

Hackers are not bad people.

The criminals are bad
people, but hackers, nah.

My thing now, right, is to tell my story,

to tell people that hackers
really aren't bad people.

Hackers really have a story to tell too.

I have a story to tell and I'm telling it

and I'm almost done telling it,

but we're just like anyone else.

We live, we breathe.

We have feelings.

We actually overindulge in our feelings

because we wonder what
people are always doing

and what the next best thing is.

I painted my pinky pink back in 2006

because a friend of mine, I
was visiting a friend of mine

in Fort Myers and her daughter
came and tugged on me.

She said, "Hey, why are
you such a bad hacker?

"Why don't you be a good
hacker and do good things."

And ever since then, man,

I've advocated for doing
good things with your skills.

Helping people,

helping others,

not doing something for yourself,

doing something for others,

making sure that you know your mom and dad

wakes up in the morning

without their shit being
sold on a dark market

and to help people, right?

To help people achieve their goals,

to help people understand who they are,

not just by where they've been

or what they've seen and the
shit that they've been through,

but to help people understand how to get

to where they're going by telling them

what I've been through, the
shit that I've been through.

I've been through some real
serious shit in my life,

but that's never deterred
me from becoming who I am

and who I expect to be.

And it really hasn't stopped
me from helping others

and showing other people the way.

With this pink pinky nail now,

that young lady just
got married this year.

And that's my goal, right?

To help as many ladies, as
many women, as many females

get into cybersecurity.

It's not just a guys thing.

It's just not a sausage
fest of guys walking around

saying they hacked something.

It's about people who are
critical thinkers, who contribute,

who care and have empathy
and share their knowledge.

That's what it's about.

And that's what I'm here
to help people understand

and to help people and encourage people

to do with their skills.

Yeah, man.

I've seen a lot.

I've been through a lot.

I have my jump bag right here

with my Bitcoin collection on
'em and I'll show Mark after.

The only thing that I can
encourage people to do

is never give up, always
hold your head high,

and never, ever, ever,
ever consider giving up,

no matter how tough things may get,

because one way or
another, you'll find a way,

you'll find a path.

And so hopefully, what I've
said, hopefully, my story helps.

I don't know.

But if it reaches one
person and it gives someone

that motivation to say, hey,
you know, I can do that too.

You know, I can go from living in cars

to consulting with
celebrities and governments.

Well then, you can do it too.

So there's nothing that you can do.

There's nothing that we can't do.

It's only about what you choose to do

and the decisions that we all make.

And so I choose to do the right thing.

I choose to make the right decisions

and I choose to make the right call.

And so that's my story.

- [Mark] All right.

Thank you, Gummo.
- Thanks.

（叹气）
‑  我叫Gummo，我是一名黑客。
在过去的  36  年里，我一直是一名黑客。
我来这里是为了讲述我的故事。
我的故事很早就开始了，对吧？我出生和长大
佛罗里达州杰克逊维尔。
长大后绝对是一贫如洗，我有一个哥哥。
我有两个哥哥，一个<font color="red">同父异母的兄弟</font>和一个<font color="red">天生的兄弟姐妹</font>。
我们所有人都在杰克逊维尔长大。在杰克逊维尔长大，我们只有一个妈妈，我们的妈妈。
她一个人<font color="red">抚养我们</font>，我们三个，尽她所
能。
她是个<font color="red">酒鬼</font>
她尽最大努力抚养三个男孩。
1985  年，我  12  岁时，我妈妈<font color="red">去世了</font>。
实际上，我实际上是在  1985  年  12  月  7  日醒来的，然后⋯⋯拉开被子，我妈妈就在那里。
所以从那以后，我就<font color="red">一直靠自己</font>。
我哥哥和我，我们去和我姑妈住，但她很
惨地失败了。
我父亲在监狱里。
所以真的别无选择，只能和家人的朋友住在
一起，我们做了一段时间。
而我的兄弟，他比我大一岁半，所以他比较自由。
他只是上路了。
在  16  岁时继续做他的事。
到那个时候，我已经  14  岁半了，而且真的是靠我自己。
那时我
发现了电脑，对吧？实际上，大约在我母亲去世前三年，我发现了电脑。
从来没有真正考虑过它
任何其他八岁、九岁、十岁的正常孩子。
就这样一直到我妈妈去世。
而在她去世之前，也就是她去世的那天晚上，
她从我哥哥毕业回家，我同父异母的弟弟在本宁堡完成了基础
训练。
她睡前告诉我的事情是
她问我计算机学习进展如何，我骗了她，对吧？
我说，他们进展顺利。
事实上，我真的什么都没做。
然后她通过了，对吧？
当你  12  岁、13  岁时，你会处理你可以处理的事情。
我的出路是电脑。
首先，我像其他孩子一样退出了。
我想，我不知道。
其次，我开始掌握我的电脑。
我有一台  TRS‑80  Model  II
我自学了如何编码，基本的编码。
几年来，这就是我所在的地方，对
吧？
当人们问我是否还好时，是的，我很好，是的，但我的成绩真的很糟糕。
我有几个朋友很要好，但没有一个特别特别，但我确实更退缩了
进入我的电脑，对吧？
我得到了一个声学调制解调器，将它连
接到本地公告板，然后开始结识其他人，开始结识像我这样的其他人。
然后人们问你，对吧？他们想知道你是谁。
那时的互联网真的不是人们现在想的那样。
它或多或少是拨号板、阿帕网、闭环系统，诸如此类。
但我在本地  BBS  系统上设置了一个公告板，在  14  岁的时候，我开始在网上结
识其他黑客。我开始学习
很多很酷的事情，比如<font color="red">电话诈骗</font>，比如如何拨打免费电话。
我发现了一种<font color="red">亚文化</font>
在电话线上的人中，在他们所在
的电话线上，你可以和伦敦、巴黎、乔治亚州或洛杉矶的人交谈。
可以这么说，您可以在这些电话线的电话上与这些人会面。  14  岁，我正在学习如何破解电话系统。
盗用电话系统是一种实际访问旧电话系统的方法，旧电话系统具有特殊的说明、代码和方法，自从电话系统数字化以来，这些系统早已失效。
所以  14  岁，我正在学习如何自己编码。
我已经建立了一个公告板，我正在与黑客会面并获得建议。
我正在学习如何做事。
我正在学习如何获得我需要的东西，对吧？
因为我和家人的朋友住在一起，他
们真的...
他们自己也几乎无法支持我，他们自己也几乎无法支持。
所以我所做的一切都是为了自己，对吧？
一切。
从食物到钱，为了钱买⾐服，为了学校，一切。
我的整个存在<font color="red">取决于</font> 我是否愿意确保自己照
顾好自己。
这就是我学会的方法。
我学会了如何，在  15  岁的时
候，
我参加了  Bell  &amp;  Howell  语言<font color="red">硕士</font> 课程，并学会了如何
重新编程信用卡以在商店和自动取款机中使用它们早在  ATM  真正拥有<font color="red">专用</font>  ATM  线路之前验证交易。
当然，我会理解批处理过程和所有这些。
但那是32年前的事了。
我刚刚学会了如何<font color="red">操纵</font> 事物来获得我想要的东西，无论是打印食品的  UPC  代码
从我需要的商店或做<font color="red">磁性</font> 气体手柄翻转的商店。
在那些日子里，当您需要为汽车加油时，加油<font color="red">泵</font> 上有一个刻度盘，您可以打开和关闭刻度盘。
好吧，如果你拿一个老式
的扬声器磁铁把它放在手柄旁边，它就会向上翻转并接合泵。
泵将开始运行以在软管中分配气体，但数字不会转动。
所以我一直在学习这些技巧，对吧？
我一直在学习生存的小技巧，生存技巧，学习如何对人们进行社会工程以获得我想要的东西，无论是访问
到我想拨入的特定计算机
窃取一些文件，或者是否是
<font color="red">说服</font> 超市经理我留下了一些食物，而实际上我没有留下，只是为了那天晚上我可以吃东西。
所以只是长大，在网上遇到黑客，人们给我的感觉是有价值的建议
为了生存，为了能够不陷入糟糕的境地。
而这正是我如何让自己不分崩离析，不<font color="red">陷入困境</font> 。
还有所有的野生动物，对吧？我仍然生活在一起
家人的朋友。  1989年即将到来。我16岁，17岁。
家里的朋友真的<font color="red">受够了</font> 我住在那里，所以正式分道扬镳吧？
所以我就在那里，我刚满  17  岁，我独自一人。
我有一辆雪佛兰  Chevette，一辆  1984  Chevrolet  Chevette，不，一辆  1982  Chevrolet  Chevette，粉蓝色，我所有的东西都在里面，包括我的  TRS‑80  Model  II。
在  1989  年的大部分时间里，我都住在我的车里。
这很艰难，对吧？我<font color="red">辍学了</font>。
我开始失去焦点。
我开始偷车，开始以非常非常独特的方式使用我的技
能快速赚钱，因为当你住在你的车里时，你有什么选择？
所以，是的，我这样做了大约一年。
后来我认识了一个女孩，她成了我的女朋友。
最终她成为了我的妻子，她帮助我意识到了我的能力，她的家人接纳了我并...
我去找了一份工作，只是装袋
杂货和狗屎，然后⋯⋯一直在做，对吧？
有人相信我。
并且仍然坚持使用计算机。
有一个女儿。
我女儿今年  12  月满  30  岁。
我和妻子生了一个女儿。
我意识到我需要做得更好，需要做得更多，为我的妻子和女儿提供更多。
所以我在那里，装袋杂货，在零售店工作，实际上努力工作并继续我的计算机学习，自学  C、
COBOL、FORTRAN，所有的旧语言，
以每小时  5  美元的价格自学计算机语言并照顾妻子和孩
子，我一直这样做。
大约两年后，我得到了机会，我存了足够的钱去
参加德国的混沌大会，这是黑客的<font color="red">年度会议</font>
来自世界各地。
我遇到了一些像我一样的黑客<font color="red">他们不仅经历了一场斗争，而且还在继续经历一场斗争</font>。
我遇到了我的一个朋友，他的名字叫  Boris  Floricic。
他的黑客名字叫  Tron，我们成了很好的朋友。
鲍里斯和我，我们做了很多聪明的事
卡系统在一起。
他教我智能卡，钱包里每个人都随身携带
的小芯片卡，你钱包里的东西。
当时，没有人真正知道智能卡是什么。
它们当时仅在欧洲广泛使用。
所以鲍里斯教我智能卡，这些有电脑的东西，里面有微处理器。
他告诉我，这些东西控制着很多事情，从电视访问到电话访问，再到<font color="red">拨打和接听长途电话</font>。
所以我们研究了一个
加密卡计划一起到我们能够做到的地方
实际上对五个不同的供应商进
行了<font color="red">逆向工程</font>，这些供应商为其服务发行了芯片卡和智能卡。
我们成功解密了这些服务。
有了这些知识，我们成为朋友后，几年后，我们开始来回交谈。
那时，这是	94。
现在我每年都参加  CAS  大会并与  Boris  
会面，我们就各种技术，尤其是智能卡来
回聊天。
大约在那个时候，在美国，休斯空间系统公司准备推出一个名为  
DirecTV  的系统。
当时实际上它被称为  DSS，即数字<font color="red">卫星</font> 系统。
休斯从头开始构建了这个系统。
我对此很感兴趣。我对此感兴趣的原因
因为此时是1995年，我父亲刚出狱。
所以我去拜访他，他正在看电视。
我说：“哦，爸爸，那是什么？”
他说，“哦，这是一个名为  DirecTV  的卫星系统。” 我对图片质量和它的外观感到惊讶。
这一切都发生在 18寸的小碟子。
所以这很吸引人。
我看着
系统，我意识到它是受控的，所有的授权
你猜对了，它是由智能卡控制的。
所以鲍里斯和我之间真的很少甚至不费吹灰之力
在  DirecTV  F  卡上进行合作，这基本上是一张允许授权的智能卡
让客户接收HBO，所有的渠道，对吧？
按次付费等。
我们成功地创建了一个非常简陋的系统来重新编程这些卡片并一笑置之。
之后真的是什么都没有想到。
然后几个月过去了，对吧？忙了几年，
我要去上学，实际上在一家地毯清洁公司工作。
真的只是生存，支付账单并继续提高我
的技能。
我想，好吧，你知道的，你知道的，你知道，我真的需要更多的钱。
我女儿正准备上学。
所以我想把她送进一所学校。
所以我决定卖掉
我为  DirecTV  卫星接入卡编程的产品。
这就是我所做的。
我意识到这是
为不想支付账单的人提供服务很容易赚钱。
我真的很想提高自己的水平，对吧？所以鲍里斯和我，我们一起研究了一些可扩展的想法，我们创建了一些软件
我们卖给加拿大人，我们赚了一些钱，对吧？
我们每个人都赚了  1000  万美元，我能够得到我想要的一切，鲍里斯也是如此。
这很棒，但还有更多的因素
不仅仅是鲍里斯和我发布代码。
还有其他缓解因素。
你有一整个营
来自  Rupert  Murdochs  的黑客并试图绕过其
他服务和<font color="red">竞争对手</font> 来摧毁他们，他们最终做到了，但那是另一回事了。
所以我们入侵了  DirecTV  几年并赚了一些钱，然后<font color="red">被抓住了</font>。
然后在我被抓住之后，我得到了一个机会，对吧？
与其去坐牢，不如去咨询
并帮助当时一家名为  NDS  的公司
帮助他们解决条件访问问题，
那时，整个  DirecTV  系统完全
被攻破，NDS  正在寻找一种方法来<font color="red">杜绝盗版</font>。
所以咨询了一些
在以色列海法呆了几年的好心人，然后继
续我的路。
回到杰克逊维尔
在进行咨询后，获得了  DirecTV  第  4  期卡，
对这项技术有很大帮助。
继续前进，回到家，我的名字有点飘到了错误的
方向。
这个在做  DirecTV  卡的人，他的妻子是一名调度员，她获得了我的信息，然后是我妻子的信息，然后是我家人的信息，那时她几乎把我
搞砸了。
而在那个时候，doxing一个人真的是一件很可怕的事情，比如现在，对吧？
当有人在互联网上攻击您或发布您的信息时。
经历是一件很糟糕的事情。
在我的情况下，我与政府有更多的关系，所以...
在政府的大力帮助和我自己现在的自我<font color="red">激励</font> 下，我搬家了。
我搬到了印第安纳州。
收拾好孩子们，收拾好所有东西，然后搬到印第安纳州。我只是想<font color="red">低调</font> 一会儿。
我刚从以色列回来，我从佛罗里达搬到印第安纳，真的有点放松。
我在一家报纸找到了一份工作并处理了他们的网站
所有这一切，真正低调、低技术的工作，没什么花哨的，住在玉米地中间，可以这么说，享
受它，享受几年的生活。
然后我被要求...
然后是我在印第安纳州遇到的一位绅士
邀请我去芝加哥看看他的生意，看看什么样的技术建议
我可以给他做生意。
所以我去了芝加哥，几天之内就认识了他。关于我的背景，他了解了我的真实身份。
我去为他工作。
在这一点上，对，现在我有一份工作，
我正在为他的公司设置  IT  基础设施，并确保他
的所有办公室都连接起来。
不仅如此，而且安全，对吧？那时网络安全真的不是问题。
它甚至几乎没有被提及。
但对我来说，网络安全，对，现在存在的东西，或者人们现在意识到的网络安全，对我来说只是事后的想法或事后的想法。
仍然是心理上的说法，因为人们写论文、谈论、创建解决方案的事情，这些都是建立在技术上的东
西，这些技术是在
互联网诞生了，对吧？
每个人都在谈论  1970  年代的技术，而没有人真正试图解决这个问题。
但是，是的，所以我为他，他的公司提供了网络安全。
设置整个交易。
然后刚刚开始在芝加哥结识新朋友。
在芝加哥就是这样。
一件事导致了另一件事。
遇到了一位名叫威拉德哈珀的绅士，威拉德巴迪哈珀。
他曾在芝加哥的  CME  工作。
他确实是世界上最大的生猪贸易商之一。
他让我有机会为  CME  创建一些特殊的网络以连接到纽约证
券交易所。就这样，之后
做其中几个，意思是，它们对我来说真的很简单，但我创造了一些超
只有  CME  和  NYSE  仍在使用的高速专用
网络。
所以他对此印象深刻，他就像，“你还能做什么？”
而我就像
‑  只是让人们知道这一点，芝加哥商品交易所和纽约<font color="red">证券交易所</font>。
‑  这是正确的，是的，是的。
因此，我专门为这两个交易所设置了两条<font color="red">双向</font> 独特的光纤线路并固定它们。
所以，是的，他问我下一步是什么。
所以我想，“嘿，有个东西叫比特币。
“这有点激起了我的兴趣。” 他问我需要什么。
我说：“大约一百万美元就行了。”
他真的打开了一个文件柜，里面有一百万美元。
他就像，“好吧，去做吧。” 这就是我所做的。
那时，我建造了一台能够挖掘比特币的超级计算机。
我挖了大约  5,000  个比特币。
那时，我相信比特币的交易价
格为每枚硬币  200  至  300  美元。所以他印象深刻，实际上我也是。
所以我们又建了三个
在接下来的八个月里。
我又建了三个
他们就在西范布伦  107  号
芝加哥商品交易所对面的街道
而且只是吸电。但在那结束时一年半的运行，我们能够开采
接近  80,000  比特币。
所以，是的，
在这样做了几年之后，我真的觉得有点成就感，但我真的不觉得我已经完成了。
所以我遇到了一位绅士......（笑）
所以我在芝加哥挥霍，对吧？
我挖了一些比特币，我在闲逛，在环路上走来走去，在千禧公园闲逛，只是和我的朋友们<font color="red">闲逛</font>。
回过头来，我遇到了一位先生，他说，
嘿，你知道，我们公司需要一个网站管
理员，对吧？
网站管理员基本上只是为公司做网络工作的人。
我很好，是的，当然。
是的，我会来做你的站长，对吧？
因为有一份工作，有一份<font color="red">合法的</font>工作才能完成我的身份，对吧？
我可以坐下来做
不管我想赚钱，但最后，我认为这是关于诚实的朝
九晚五的工作。
所以，是的。
是的，嘿杰克逊，我会去工作，在你的软件公司做网站管
理员。
所以我去上班了
作为他们的网站管理员
这很有趣，对吧？他们是<font color="red">副总统</font>。
他们就像，“嗯，这是一项非常重要
的工作”，你应该胡说八道。
我是，是的，先生，是的，女士。
我真的尽可能长时间地保持这个诡计，但我被在那里工作的一个朋友打败了
他把我告发给营销经理和营销经理，她把我<font color="red">告发</font> 给全体员工
最终我开始负责他们的网络安全实践。
所以我想，好吧，狗屎，我想我在做网络安全。
所以我在这里为芝加哥的一家软件公司做网络安全，这是<font color="red">无意的</font>，对吧？
但我正在磨练我的技能，对吧？
找出最好的方法来支持特定的协议和系统以及从
网络安全的观点。这就是我所做的。
我做得很好。
但后来他们解雇了我。
然后他们只是，他们解雇了我。所以，是的，这是主人和我之间的事情。
他不喜欢我和我
肯定不喜欢他。
所以现在公开了，我真的不喜欢他。
所以在那之后，对，我只是参加
了几场网络安全演出，只是⋯⋯只是做
了我的事，在芝加哥的整个时间收拾我的东西，
然后回到杰克逊维尔。
再一次，与一家公司就网络安全进行咨询，我很享受。
但这就是导致我的原因到我现在的位置，对吧？
从其中一些角度。
我一直负责把一些重量级的击球手
赶走。
我从事法律工作
在过去的执法中，一些真正的重量级
人物。
我真的很擅长追捕黑客和寻找人，而不只是寻找人，而是寻找真正的黑客，对吧？
真正的黑客是
真正<font color="red">造成混乱</font>。
我就是那个寻找那个黑客的人。我非常认真地这样做并继续这样做
因为我不仅为公司提供服务，对吧，还为名人
和明星提供服务，对吗？
他们和我商量。
我亲自与他们合作，解决他们遇到的任何网络安全问题。
人们不明白的一些事情是，每个人都随身携带智能手机，看着爱德华·斯诺登做所有这些荒谬的事情，躲在被子里什么的。
每个人都应该知道
你的智能手机是一台PC，是一台便携式计算机，而智能手机能做的事情是非常可怕的。
就在最近，我在  iOS  上使用了多年的一个<font color="red">漏洞</font>，它允许我实际监听您的电话对话，阅读您的  
SMS  消息，阅读您的电子邮件，实际查看您在  iOS  设备上所做的一切。
这种漏洞无处不在。
几乎所有东西都装有  GPS  芯片。几乎每个设备中都有一个芯片。
如果它里面有芯片，它就可以被利用。
当事物被利用时，有时设备、系统和人会出于某种原因而被利用。
外面有很多非常可怕的东西。
现在有人卖你的信息。
他们正在出售您的  wi	i  网络。他们正在出售您的  wi	i  <font color="red">凭据</font>。
他们正在出售您的  
ancestry.com  家谱数据。他们正在出售所有这些。人们真正不明白的是，这个世界真的没有<font color="red">隐私</font> 了，除非你去南方某处的岛上生活
太平洋没有电也没有其他人，有东西可以利用，还有系统和设备等等。
现在，一个专业的偷车贼偷车大约需要  
30  秒，因为你真的不需要热线任何东西，也不需要使用螺丝刀甚至笔记本电脑。
你可以使用一个射频拦截或拦截设备，它可以做一个人
攻击的中间只需一个密钥卡，您就可以用它偷走某人价值  
150,000  美元的汽车。
那里的技术堆栈是无穷无尽的
正在被利用。
最值得注意的是<font color="red">蜂窝系统</font>、移动系统，人们随身携带的东西最多，包含最多的价值和最多的数据。
将您的信息放在  TikTok  上，创建一个  TikTok  帐户并
从许多地方拍摄。
你没有意识到你真正在做的是你真的把你所拥有的一切，私下
里的占有欲都给了世界。
这就是我们看到的
被攻击的人。
人们，他们的银行账户被盗，等等。
说到银行账户，很多人意识到当你登录你的银行时，很多银行会<font color="red">否认这一点</font>，但银行实际上对你的账户，进入你的系统有后门。
想一想。
当您通过  suchandsuch.com  登录您的银行账户时，您必须回答所有这些荒谬的问题并收到一条双因素  SMS  消息发送给您，这样您就可以输入代码。
但人们真的没有意识到他们的银行也有后门访问
到您的  TurboTax  和资金管理软件之类的应用程序，所有这些。
您认为这与您的银行有何联系？
所以有了这些后门
连接到银行
事情在本质上仍然不安全。
我们每天都会看到数以百万计的人的信息被盗的数据泄露事件。
不仅被盗，而且被出售和用来对付他们。
我们还必须意识到的一件事
是我们有<font color="red">量子计算机</font> 来了。
量子计算机将使所有当前和以前的加密算法绝对<font color="red">过时</font>。
因此，如果你有一些过去加密过的东西，或者你有一些加密的文件，它们已经在互联网上的任何地方，在书中，在任何其他人可以访问的地方
您的加密文件。
好吧，很快这些文件将不会长时间保持加密状态。
所以希望这些秘密被很好地加密了。
网站。
网站有很多<font color="red">缺陷</font>。现在每个人都需要一个网站。
每个人都有一个网站可以访问，他们最喜欢的网站。  （叹气）
目前，大约  90%  的  Web  和在您的网站中的应用程序中支持它们的技术是不安全的，它
们本质上是不安全的。
不管是不是网络
服务器在您的服务器上运行开放端口或错误配置文件。
有件事... 有一点点
每个人都可以利用的东西，现在每个人都在付出代价。
现在每个人都成为这些罪行的<font color="red">受害者</font>
到他们认为自己不是受害者的地方，他们从未想过自己实际上会成为受害者的地方。
移动应用程序越多，使用我们刚刚使用的手机
的人就越多⋯⋯
使用移动设备的人越多，就需要更多的移动应用程序，需要更多的数据中心，需要更多的服务器来<font color="red">满足这些需求</font>
要连接的应用程序。
而这些都处于危险之中。
您所要做的就是对任何人的  Web  域进行  
DNS  查询，您就可以开始发现最不安全的部分
组织和个人都是。
人们没有意识到，当他们在家时，他们在路由器上设置了密码，他们认为就是这样。
我很安全，我很安全。
但没有人真正了解使用额外保护层的背景，例如  VPN  或某种广
告拦截技术。
人们没有意识到他们的  IP  地址
基本上就像互联网上的一面旗帜
让他们被发现，让他们<font color="red">被跟踪</font>、<font color="red">骚扰</font>、<font color="red">恐吓</font>、<font color="red">殴打</font>。
没关系。
所以这一切都伴随着
了解这些技术并了解如何保护自己以及如何保护自
己免受穿着连帽衫和斗篷的坏人的伤害。
正如我所说，并非所有黑客都是坏人。
大多数黑客...
每个人都是黑客。
如果不是黑客，我们就没有wi	i。
我们不会有相机。
我们今天不会有很多我们认为理所当然的事
情。
罪犯是那些
<font color="red">给黑客起坏名声</font>。
罪犯是那些
正在闯入系统并窃取信息并造成数据泄露。
罪犯是那些
谁在跟踪人和不良环境并从不属于
的人而不是黑客那里窃取。
之前已经说过在这里我也是这么说的，对吧？
黑客不是坏人。
罪犯是坏人
人，但黑客，不。
我现在要做的就是讲述我的故事，告诉人们黑客真的不是坏人。
黑客也确实有故事要讲。
我有一个故事要讲，我正在讲，我几乎讲完了，但我们和其他人一样。
我们生活，我们<font color="red">呼吸</font>。
我们有感情。
我们实际上<font color="red">过度沉迷于自己的感受</font>，因为我们想知道什么
人们总是在做，下一件最好的事情是
什么。
我在  2006  年画了我的粉红色，因为我的一个朋友，我正在迈尔斯堡拜访我的一个朋友，她的女儿过来拉我。
她说：“嘿，为什么你是一个这么糟糕的黑客？
“你为什么不做一个优秀的黑客，做好事。”
从那以后，伙计，我一直<font color="red">提倡</font> 用你的技能做好事。
帮助别人，帮助别人，不为自己做某事，为别人
做某事，确保你知道你的爸爸妈妈早上醒来时没有在黑市上出售他们的狗屎
并帮助人们，对吗？
帮助人们实现他们的目标，帮助人们了解他们是谁，
不仅仅是通过他们去过的地方或他们所看到的以及他们经历过的狗屎，而是帮助人们了解如何到达他们想要的地方	我会告诉他们我经历过什么，我经历过的那些事。
我在生活中经历过一些真正<font color="red">严重的</font> 事情，但这从未被阻止
我从成为我是谁以及我期望成为谁。
它真的没有停止
我从帮助别人和给别人指路。
现在有了这个粉红色的小指指甲，那位年轻女
士今年才结婚。
这就是我的目标，对吧？
为了帮助尽可能多的女性、尽可能多的女性进入网络安全领域。
这不仅仅是男人的事。
这不是一个到处走来走去说他们破解了一些东西的香肠盛会。
这是关于那些<font color="red">具有批判性思维的人</font>，他
们做出贡献，关心和同情并分享他们的知识。
这就是它的意义所在。
这就是我在这里
帮助人们理解和帮助人们并鼓励人们发
挥他们的技能。
是的，伙计。我见过很多。
我经历了很多。
我的跳跃包就在这里，上面有我的比特币收藏，之后我会展示给马克看。
我能鼓励人们做的唯一一件事就是永
不放弃，永远昂首挺胸，永远，永远，永远，永远考虑放弃，无论事情变得多么艰难，因为无论如何，你会找到一条路，你就会找到一条路。
所以希望，我所说的，希望我的故事能有
所帮助。我不知道。
但如果达到一个
人，它给了某人动力说，嘿，你知道，我也能做
到。
你知道，我可以从住在车里到为名人和政府提供咨询。
那么，你也可以做到。所以你无能为力。
没有什么是我们做不到的。
这仅与您选择做什么以及我们所有人做出的决定有关。
所以我选择做正确的事。
我选择做出正确的决定，我选择做出正确的决定。
这就是我的故事。
‑  [马克]好吧。谢谢你，古莫。
‑  谢谢。
