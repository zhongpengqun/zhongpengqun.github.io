<h2 id="psychological-problem---1">Psychological problem - 1</h2>
<p>In past time, i always had some weird dreams.
There are several examples;
1, 
several times, i dreamed that i jumped from the top of a high building, and when i landed,
the real me had a big convulsion in the bed, then i wake up, and i hearded my heart beat so fast and loudly.</p>

<p>2,
i had a dreamed what i was chased by a zombie, this zombie is not the American zombie what is
look like a injured man. It is a zombie from Qing Dynasty, is not able to walk, but always jump.
with a corrupt face and long tusks.
But very straight, i’m very happy in this dream, i ran so fast, and in the dream i recognize it’s possible that
i was dreaming, but i can’t make sure, and the most attractive is i don’t know what the zombie will do,
its’ action is not controlled by me.</p>

<p>3,
The most happy dream, many times, i dreamed that i fly in the wind, i run on the water, i fly between
buildings, like shuttle back and forth.</p>

<p>4,
It was the first year since i graduated from university, i went to Shanghai to find job,
and eventually, i found a job at Songjiang district of Shanghai, and i lived in a rent room.
It was summer when i graduated, but after about 2 months, the weather became a little cold,
therefore i need to buy a 被子, i didn’t buy it immediately, i asked 房东 if there are 被子 that
the previous 租客 remained, then 房东 taken me to another room, he opened the room, wow,
the room was filled by 被子, they are all remain by previous 租客, because taking 被子 to somewhere is so
un-convenience, so many 租客 remain it.
Then i chose a 被子 which looks cleaner than others.
What weird happened in that night, i had a horrible dream!
This dream was: i was sleeping on my bed, i 平躺着, and the 被子 covered on me, the light in room
was on, and at that moment i felt that someone was standing aside by my bed, then i opened my eyes,
i saw a woman whose hair was long, if i remember correctly, a little curly, and her face i could not see clearly, she was in a long white clothes.
she standed there quietly, no any action, but i was a little scared, yes, a little, not too much.
Looks like she was not unfriendly to me.
About 5 seconds later, i waked up, and when i come back to reality and opened my eyes, everything
is almost presented as same as in the dream, beside there was no woman stand beside by my bed.</p>

<p>As busy day ends, i went off work at 6:30 p.m.</p>

<p>And then i rode my motorcycle to the City gym, i rode fast, about 70 KM/h.</p>

<p>Today there was nothing special, my basketball skill is not good, neither bad.</p>

<p>Sometimes even has highlight moment.</p>

<p>What one thing special was happened yesterday.</p>

<h5 id="2022-6-23">2022-6-23</h5>
<p>Today, i’m a bit excited, because i finished a Merge Request.
So after work, i go to the supermarket and have bought a variety of goods.</p>

<p>And i want to have a small challenge of myself, so i bought a duck and plan to make dish – beer duck.</p>

<p>Here is the detailed steps to make this dish:</p>

<h5 id="2022-6-25">2022-6-25</h5>
<p>Today is Jun 25th, yesterday i arrived in NanChang at night and then i went to my house in NanChang County.
NanChang County is a county of NanChang City.
Unfortunately, when i got home, i found the lights is unable to work, then i guessed the switch is turned off.
So i started to find where is the switch, eventually, i found it was hanged on the wall in the kitchen,
next step i brought a chair, then i standed on the chair and turned the switch on, then the lights works,
but it only works for about 10 seconds, the switch then turned off by itself, there was a problem in it.</p>

<p>It was so helpless, the temperature is so high in NanChang, but it has no way, then i spread some big papers
on the balcony as my bed.</p>

<p>Above is what happened to me at yesterday night.
And you may ask why i go to NanChang, it’s because i will go to have a dinner with Little-Fish.
Today morning, i waked up at about 8 o’clock, what surprised is i slept very well yesterday, maybe because i was
too tired, and i felt asleep at about 1 o’clock in that night.</p>

<p>We decided to meet each other at about 6 p.m today.
Then i spent much time to clean my house, because it was too messy.
I sold the paper boxes what took up too much room, and then i picked up my express deliveries which arrived at here
during i was in XinYu in last about 3 months, there are about 10 deliveries, mainly some books.</p>

<p>Time pasted fast, when i waked up from noontime snooze, it was afternoon, i began to prepare to meet Little-Fish.
I took a bath, i washed my glasses, i shaved off my bread, i washed my shoes, 
and to dislodge the foul smell of the shoes, i poured some alcohol on tissue,
then put the tissue into the shoes.</p>

<p>Time now was 4:30, i wear clothes and shoes, and Little-Fish responseed my wechat message and send a 
address to me where we will meet, the address is a restaurant which called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">遇江南(Yu JiangNan)</code>.</p>

<p>Then i walked out, and got a taxi to carry me to the nearest subway station.
There are more than 10 stops from the start stop to the destination stop, the destination stop is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">north of people's park.</code></p>

<p>I arrived at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">North of people's park</code>, the Map shows that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yu JiangNan</code> only 700 meters from me.
But i could not found it, so i got a taxi again to go to there, i arrived.
I waitting for her in front of the restaurant, and sent her a message.
She lived in a rented house nearby, she arrived here in about 8 minutes, so it was the first time i meet Little-Fish!</p>
<h2 id="todo-describe-the-sense-when-we-recognized-each-other-the-street-the-crowd-etc">TODO describe the sense when we recognized each other, the street, the crowd, etc..</h2>
<p>Recall past 2 days, i was hit by something straight, i became sensitive, maybe i’m always sensitive.
I would be melancholy when she doesn’t response to me in time in wechat or reject or avoid my admiration, i felt frustrated,
i still don’t know her thoughts about me.</p>

<p>But then i changed my perspective after one day, we are both free, i must to be her friend firstly,
to care, to follow, to help her, this world is always hardhearted, it’s even worse for a girl.
Whatever the outcome, enjoy the progress.</p>

<p>Now i saw her, we just across a narrow street, she wear a mask, glasses, a long skirt, she wear her hairs in braids.
I recognized her, so i waved to her, then she recognized me.</p>

<p>We walked along street to another restaurant which called ‘kitchen daddy’.</p>

<p>we ordered 3 dishes and then sit down, Fish removed her mask, her lip is healthy red, she smiled like a child, purity and
naturally.
We chatting while eating, we talked about old news.</p>

<h5 id="2022-6-26">2022-6-26</h5>
<p>I’m loving to write.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-8">2022-7-8</h5>
<p>M,</p>

<p>Today i feel lost and l really lost.</p>

<p>I give up the pursuit to Little-Fish, because the pursuit is 
hopeless, i feel that she is not interested in me, some people say ‘this is women, they never take the initiative to do anything’,
i don’t know.</p>

<p>But i want to keep the friendship with her, i like her, like her character, i hope she likes me too.</p>

<p>When i send out the Wechat message which i say that i decide to just keep the friendship and i will give up the pursuit,
i feel something has put down, in these weeks, i often think of her, think about our relationship, think about 
our future if we have, it makes me tired, because all these thoughts seem like is just imagination from myself.</p>

<p>Another cause is i think i’m not worthy of her. There are a lot of shortcomings and weaknesses in myself,
and also my job is not stable, maybe a man who is a civil servant、doctor、teacher is more suitable for her.</p>

<p>Anyway, there were much happy memories during these months, it makes me expect something good happen.
And we are friend, it’s good.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-9">2022-7-9</h5>
<p>I find a new enjoyable thing for me.
Reading or playing on the train.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-10">2022-7-10</h5>
<p>It’s a surprise, at about 6 p.m, Fish takes the initiative to send me a Wechat message, tells me that COVID positive re-appear in NanChang.</p>

<p>So i still have the hope, right?</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Today i bought a ticket to return to XinYu, and the train will start at 8:15 p.m.
But actually, the train is late for about half hour.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-11">2022-7-11</h5>
<p>XiaoYu(小鱼), is her nickname, it means a little fish in english.
Actually, i have not met her so far, we chat in wechat only.
She is a doctor in a hospital of XinYu City.
From this day, i will narrate her with plain and real words.</p>

<p>Below are some fragments what we chatted on Wechat.</p>

<hr />

<p>m: Are you at work?</p>

<p>f: No, today not work.</p>

<p>m: Hmm, today i felt dizziness and chest tightness.</p>

<p>f: It might be heatstroke.</p>

<p>m: No, it rained today, not so hot.</p>

<p>f: It is common that feel dizziness and chest tightness when it rains, because the air is not good, and you will fell better after it rained.
When raining, hypoxia also happens on fishes in the pool.</p>

<p>m: I think one reason may be i was troubled by some complicate code.</p>

<h5 id="2022-7-17">2022-7-17</h5>
<p>M,
………….
This night 1:47 A.M, so many thoughts flicker in my brain.</p>

<p>The regrets for my mistakes,</p>

<p>the confusion for my direction,</p>

<p>the expection for Fish’s response,</p>

<p>the contradiction for desire,</p>

<p>the respect but doubt for noble,</p>

<p>the disappointment for self-control,</p>

<p>the impulse for criminal,</p>

<p>the distrust for anyone, include myself.</p>

<p>Everything i pursuit now i doubt it’s not ture of me, just like YeGong pursuits the dragon(叶公好龙).</p>

<p>I think what makes so sensitive and vulnerable is my cowardice,</p>

<p>but if the day cowardice inside me disappears, i guess is the day i become a terrorist.</p>

<p>I lit a cigarette just now, i have smoke for over 10 years, but not continuous in the 10 years, interrupt in some years,</p>

<p>the smell of tobacco now can’t attract me, i smoke just because i feel bored,</p>

<p>the white smoke blew out from my mouth, seems telling me that my fate will always accompany me like before.</p>

<p>Let’s end here, with the song – « I’m your man » from Leonard Cohen.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TODO 叶公好龙</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="2022-7-20">2022-7-20</h5>
<p>M,
……………..
Last few days, i declared the end of pursuit to Fish again.</p>

<p>The reason is same as last time.</p>

<p>I guess this time is real end.</p>

<p>Best wishes again.</p>

<p>Today is the last day of September.
Because tomorrow my 高中 classmate Fu WenTao will 举办 his wedding, and i as one of 伴郎 participate this wedding.
This night we started to do some preparations for tomorrow’s wedding.
The 司仪 introduced the 流程 of wedding, the steps one by one, for example, first step, the 新娘 stand outside of the 大门,
and when music starts, 伴郎 and 伴娘 push the 大门, then 新娘 走进 大厅 and 站在新郎对面, 新郎 will sing a song for her, and 
单膝跪地求婚 then, at last, parents of 新郎 and 新娘 will 致辞 for all 参会者, and accept 新郎 and 新娘 的 敬拜.
We finished it at about 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>After it, i and another best-man ZhangJie which also is my 高中 classmate decided to play basketball with other classmates, we ride my motorcycle and arrived the 篮球馆, but ultimately,
we found that the 篮球馆 has been 被拆了.
So we went to a 饭馆 to 吃烧烤.</p>

<p>LiYi, PengXiang, which also are our 高中 classmates went to 烧烤店 which named LuTianXia (means roll up the world) to 吃烧烤.</p>

<p>There was so loud in the grill, our table is at inside of the house and close to the wall, on our left, there was a table that 
2 men and 2 women sitting, their voice is so loud! But it’s common in this place, this city.</p>

<p>We four talked about recent daily life which are no big different from what we often talked at previous dinners.</p>

<p>After about 20 minutes, there was a new guy came and sit at left table, looks like he was the boyfriend of the woman which 
sit against this guy.</p>

<p>At first 10 minutes, everything was alright.</p>

<p>But then at left table, the guy who is mentioned above and his girlfriend began to quarrel, the woman 摔盘子 toward to the guy.
My seat is so close to them, actually, i stand up and move away quickly after her first throwing.
She throwed about 4 盘子 toward the man, and then the man left the house.</p>

<p>Last #星期六# i came back to ShangHai, and when i arrived at ShangHaiNan station, a woman came toward me, and asked
where i want to go, i said that i need to find a #宾馆#, then she took me to a street, and 4 or 5 #宾馆# #在街边#.
I guess her job is to take passenger to the certain street and then the owner of #宾馆# pay money to her.
I reject the first #宾馆# she recommanded, because the room is so small, only a small bed in the room, and the bed almost
#占据了# the whole room, what’s worse, the height of room is so #矮的#, not higher than 1.6 meter, i have to #弯着腰# to walk on the #走廊#, such room one hundred yuan one day, so i #果断# reject it.</p>

<p>Then i found another #宾馆#, only #相隔# 10 meters, also 100 hundred yuan one day, here is the room.</p>
<h1 id="todo-pic-of-room">TODO, pic of room.</h1>

<p>Today is the last day in the #宾馆#, i will leave it tomorrow, for today i #租了# a room， #相距# 2.5 km from here.
