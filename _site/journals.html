<p>In past time, i always had some weird dreams.
There are several examples;
1, 
several times, i dreamed that i jumped from the top of a high building, and when i landed,
the real me had a big convulsion in the bed, then i wake up, and i hearded my heart beat so fast and loudly.</p>

<p>2,
i had a dreamed what i was chased by a zombie, this zombie is not the American zombie what is
look like a injured man. It is a zombie from Qing Dynasty, is not able to walk, but always jump.
with a corrupt face and long tusks.
But very straight, i’m very happy in this dream, i ran so fast, and in the dream i recognize it’s possible that
i was dreaming, but i can’t make sure, and the most attractive is i don’t know what the zombie will do,
its’ action is not controlled by me.</p>

<p>3,
The most happy dream, many times, i dreamed that i fly in the wind, i run on the water, i fly between
buildings, like shuttle back and forth.</p>

<p>4,
It was the first year since i graduated from university, i went to Shanghai to find job,
and eventually, i found a job at Songjiang district of Shanghai, and i lived in a rent room.
It was summer when i graduated, but after about 2 months, the weather became a little cold,
therefore i need to buy a 被子, i didn’t buy it immediately, i asked 房东 if there are 被子 that
the previous 租客 remained, then 房东 taken me to another room, he opened the room, wow,
the room was filled by 被子, they are all remain by previous 租客, because taking 被子 to somewhere is so
un-convenience, so many 租客 remain it.
Then i chose a 被子 which looks cleaner than others.
What weird happened in that night, i had a horrible dream!
This dream was: i was sleeping on my bed, i 平躺着, and the 被子 covered on me, the light in room
was on, and at that moment i felt that someone was standing aside by my bed, then i opened my eyes,
i saw a woman whose hair was long, if i remember correctly, a little curly, and her face i could not see clearly, she was in a long white clothes.
she standed there quietly, no any action, but i was a little scared, yes, a little, not too much.
Looks like she was not unfriendly to me.
About 5 seconds later, i waked up, and when i come back to reality and opened my eyes, everything
is almost presented as same as in the dream, beside there was no woman stand beside by my bed.</p>
