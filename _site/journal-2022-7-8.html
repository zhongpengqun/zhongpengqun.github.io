<h2 id="end-of-pursuit">End of pursuit</h2>
<p>Today i feel lost and l really lost.</p>

<p>I give up the pursuit to Little-Fish, because the pursuit is 
hopeless, i feel that she is not interested in me, some people say ‘this is women, they never take the initiative to do anything’,
i don’t know.</p>

<p>But i want to keep the friendship with her, i like her, like her character, i hope she likes me too.</p>

<p>When i send out the Wechat message which i say that i decide to just keep the friendship and i will give up the pursuit,
i feel something has put down, in these weeks, i often think of her, think about our relationship, think about 
our future if we have, it makes me tired, because all these thoughts seem like is just imagination from myself.</p>

<p>Another cause is i think i’m not worthy of her. There are a lot of shortcomings and weaknesses in myself,
and also my job is not stable, maybe a man who is a civil servant、doctor、teacher is more suitable for her.</p>

<p>Anyway, there were much happy memories during these months, it makes me expect something good happen.
And we are friend, it’s good.</p>
