<p>In receiving the distinction with which your free Academy has so generously honoured()….啊呢的…. me, my gratitude(感激之情)….葛入啊剃臭(新余)的…. has been profound, particularly….婆踢Q勒利…. when I consider the extent to which this recompense has surpassed my personal merits(优点)….咪瑞自….</p>

<p>尊敬的国王和皇后陛下，尊敬的王室成员，女士们，先生们：秉承自由精神的贵学院慷慨授予我这份殊荣，我自认我的成就远远配不上它的分量，所以更是由衷地心怀感激</p>

<hr />

<p>Every man, and for stronger reasons, every artist, wants to be recognized</p>

<p>所有人都渴望得到认可，艺术家就更为如此</p>

<hr />

<p>So do I</p>

<p>我也是一样</p>

<hr />

<p>But I have not been able to learn of your decision without comparing its repercussions(影响)….瑞泼咔迅四…. to what I really am</p>

<p>只有当我将你们的决定所产生的影响与真实的我进行比较之后，我才真正理解你们何以作了这样一个决定</p>

<hr />

<p>A man almost young, rich only in his doubts and with his work still in progress, accustomed(习惯了)….啊customed…. to living in the solitude(孤独)….梭(新余话)了臭（新余话）的…. of work or in the retreats(撤退)….瑞催自…. of friendship: how would he not feel a kind of panic at hearing the decree(法令)….底克瑞…. that transports him all of a sudden, alone and reduced to himself, to the centre of a glaring(明显的)….葛辣润…. light? And with what feelings could he accept this honour at a time when other writers in Europe, among them the very greatest, are condemned(谴责)….肯den(4)的…. to silence, and even at a time when the country of his birth is going through unending misery?I felt that shock and inner turmoil(动荡)….特墨oil….</p>

<p>一个尚且年轻的人，除了疑惑一无所有，他的作品尚未成型，并且习惯于在工作中孤独地生活，对各种示好也退避三舍，对于这样一个离群索居的人来说，突然被逮到，并抛置于这耀眼的聚光灯下，又怎么能不感到一种恐慌呢？当欧洲其他的作家，哪怕是其中最伟大的一些作家，都被迫保持沉默，当他的故土，正遭受着无止境的苦难，他将以怎样的心情来接受这份荣誉呢？我就经历了这种内心的惶恐与不安</p>

<hr />

<p>In order to regain(恢复)….蕊gay摁…. peace I have had, in short, to come to terms with a too generous fortune</p>

<p>为了重新获得平静，我只能接受这份命运慷慨的馈赠</p>

<hr />

<p>And since I cannot live up to it by merely(仅仅是)….密二利…. resting on my achievement, I have found nothing to support me but what has supported me through all my life, even in the most contrary(相反)….肯缺瑞…. circumstances: the idea that I have of my art and of the role of the writer</p>

<p>既然我的成就无法与这份奖项匹配，我便只能倚赖那份支撑着我人生的信念，即便在最艰难的境况下也未曾抛却我的那份信念：那就是我对我的艺术以及对作家这一角色的看法</p>

<hr />

<p>Let me only tell you, in a spirit of gratitude(感激之情)….葛入啊剃臭(新余)的…. and friendship, as simply as I can, what this idea is</p>

<p>让我怀着感激和友好的心情，对大家尽可能简短地表达一下这个想法</p>

<hr />

<p>For myself, I cannot live without my art</p>

<p>于我而言，没有艺术，我便无法存活</p>

<hr />

<p>But I have never placed it above everything</p>

<p>但我从没有把这份艺术置于一切之上，</p>

<hr />

<p>If, on the other hand, I need it, it is because it cannot be separated from my fellow men, and it allows me to live, such as I am, on one level with them</p>

<p>相反，它之所以对我而言不可或缺，正是因为它与所有人紧紧相连，并且允许像我这样的一个人能和大家一样生活下去</p>

<hr />

<p>It is a means of stirring(激动人心的)….死的润…. the greatest number of people by offering them a privileged(享有特权的)….普瑞沃利巨的…. picture of common joys and sufferings</p>

<p>艺术在我看来并不是一场孤独的狂欢, 艺术是一种手段，它以其特有的方式呈现了人类共同的苦难与欢乐，从而感动了大多数的人</p>

<hr />

<p>It obliges(要求)….啊波来(1声)撅四…. the artist not to keep himself apart; it subjects him to the most humble and the most universal truth</p>

<p>所以它迫使艺术家不再自我孤立，使其屈从于一种最为质朴、最为普世的真理</p>

<hr />

<p>And often he who has chosen the fate(命运)….废特…. of the artist because he felt himself to be different soon realizes that he can maintain….命(一声)藤(4声)…. neither his art nor his difference unless he admits that he is like the others</p>

<p>而通常情况下，那个自认与众不同而选择艺术生涯的人很快就会发现，只有承认自己与众生的共性，他的艺术和他的独特才能从中得到滋养</p>

<hr />

<p>The artist forges(伪造)….for(1声)撅四…. himself to the others, midway between the beauty he cannot do without and the community he cannot tear himself away from</p>

<p>正是在这种自身与他者不断的往来中、在与他不可搁置的美以及不可抽离的群体的交往之中，艺术家得到了自我锤炼</p>

<hr />

<p>That is why true artists scorn nothing: they are obliged()….鹅波赖聚的…. to understand rather than to judge</p>

<p>这也是为什么真正的艺术家不会蔑视任何东西；他们要求自己必须理解一切，而不是评判一切</p>

<hr />

<p>And if they have to take sides in this world, they can perhaps side only with that society in which, according to Nietzsche’s great words, not the judge but the creator….可瑞A特…. will rule, whether he be a worker or an intellectual()….因特le克却….</p>

<p>如果他们必须在这个世界上选择一个阵营，那他们或许只能属于尼采的伟大言论中所构建的那种社会：一个由创造者而不是评判者来统治的社会，无论这里的创造者是劳动人民还是知识分子</p>

<hr />

<p>By the same token, the writer’s role is not free from difficult duties</p>

<p>同样地，作家这一角色也被赋予了艰难的职责</p>

<hr />

<p>By definition….折(新余)飞(新余)你(新余)迅…. he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make history; he is at the service of those who suffer it</p>

<p>身为作家，在如今这个年代，他不该为制造历史的人服务，他应该为承受历史的人服务</p>

<hr />

<p>Otherwise, he will be alone and deprived of his art</p>

<p>否则，他将被孤立，也将失去他的艺术</p>

<hr />

<p>Not all the armies of tyranny()….踢热你…. with their millions of men will free him from his isolation, even and particularly….婆踢Q勒利…. if he falls into step with them</p>

<p>一个作家，若是与独裁者为伍，那么即便独裁者有千军万马与之同行，他也依然无法摆脱那种孤独</p>

<hr />

<p>But the silence of an unknown prisoner, abandoned to humiliations at the other end of the world, is enough to draw the writer out of his exile, at least whenever, in the midst()….密自特…. of the privileges….(普洛V二)倔(4)四…. of freedom, he manages not to forget that silence, and to transmit it in order to make it resound by means of his art</p>

<p>但世界另一头，一个被遗弃在屈辱中的无名之囚，他的沉默却足以一次又一次将作家从这种孤独的流放中拯救出来，只要他在享有自由权利的同时，始终不忘这种沉默，并以艺术的方式来使这种沉默发出声响</p>

<hr />

<p>None of us is great enough for such a task</p>

<p>我们中任何人都没有伟大到足以承担这一使命</p>

<hr />

<p>But in all circumstances of life, in obscurity or temporary(临时)….ten(1)破瑞二利…. fame, cast in the irons(熨斗)….爱摁四…. of tyranny()….踢热你…. or for a time free to express himself, the writer can win the heart of a living community that will justify(证明)….撅四踢five…. him, on the one condition that he will accept to the limit of his abilities the two tasks that constitute the greatness of his craft: the service of truth and the service of liberty(自由)….粒波剃….</p>

<p>但是在他一生的境遇中，无论是门庭冷落还是扬名一时，无论是被压制于暴政的桎梏之下还是拥有一时的言论自由，作家只有忠心耿耿竭尽所能地为真理和自由服务，他的职业才能因此变得伟大，他才能得到民众发自肺腑的正名</p>

<hr />

<p>Because his task is to unite the greatest possible number of people, his art must not compromise with lies and servitude(奴役)….奢为tude…. which, wherever they rule, breed(品种)….补瑞的…. solitude(孤独)….梭(新余话)了臭（新余话）的….</p>

<p>作家的使命，就是团结尽可能多的人，这个使命不应屈服于谎言和奴役，因为在谎言和奴役统治的土地上，处处囚禁着孤独的灵魂</p>

<hr />

<p>Whatever our personal weaknesses may be, the nobility of our craft will always be rooted in two commitments, difficult to maintain: the refusal(拒绝)….refu走…. to lie about what one knows and the resistance(电阻)….瑞z四ten四…. to oppression</p>

<p>无论我们作为个人有着怎样的弱点，我们职业的高贵却永远扎根在两个并不容易坚守的承诺里：对于知晓的事，绝无谎言；对于任何压迫，反抗到底</p>

<hr />

<p>For more than twenty years of an insane history, hopelessly lost like all the men of my generation in the convulsions(抽搐)….肯窝选四…. of time, I have been supported by one thing: by the hidden feeling that to write today was an honour because this activity was a commitment….可密特ment…. – and a commitment….可密特ment…. not only to write</p>

<p>在二十多年的荒诞历程中，孤立无援的我和同代人一样，迷失在时代的跌宕变迁中， 仅靠内心隐隐的一种感觉支撑着：在当今这个世界，写作是一种光荣，因为这一行为肩负使命，并迫使你不仅仅去写作</p>

<hr />

<p>Specifically, in view of my powers and my state of being, it was a commitment….可密特ment…. to bear, together with all those who were living through the same history, the misery and the hope we shared</p>

<p>它尤其迫使我按我自己的方式，以我的一己之力，与所有和我一样经历过那段历史的人一起去承担起我们共有的那种痛苦与希冀</p>

<hr />

<p>These men, who were born at the beginning of the First World War, who were twenty when Hitler came to power and the first revolutionary trials(试用)….try呕四…. were beginning, who were then confronted as a completion of their education with the Spanish Civil War, the Second World War, the world of concentration()….康渗催迅…. camps, a Europe of torture()….拖却…. and prisons….普瑞震自…. – these men must today rear(后)….瑞二…. their sons and create their works in a world threatened by nuclear destruction</p>

<p>这些人，出生于第一次世界大战之初；希特勒政权建立和最初的革命浪潮掀起时，他们又正值二十多岁, 接着，像是要使他们的经历更加完整，他们又经历了西班牙内战、第二次世界大战，他们经历了那个满目疮痍、遍地集中营和牢狱的欧洲，而如今，正是他们这些人，又要在毁灭性核武器的威胁下，抚育他们的下一代，完成他们的使命</p>

<hr />

<p>Nobody, I think, can ask them to be optimists(乐观主义者)….哦铺剃密四自….</p>

<p>我想，没有任何人有权利要求他们乐观</p>

<hr />

<p>And I even think that we should understand – without ceasing(停止)….C-sing…. to fight it – the error of those who in an excess of despair have asserted(断言)….鹅奢剃的…. their right to dishonour and have rushed into the nihilism of the era()….亿弱啊….</p>

<p>我甚至主张，在与他们不断斗争的同时，我们应该理解他们的所作所为：他们只是因为与日俱增的绝望，而做出了耻辱之举，并且堕入了这个时代所盛行的虚无主义</p>

<hr />

<p>But the fact remains that most of us, in my country and in Europe, have refused this nihilism and have engaged upon a quest for legitimacy(合法性)….里巨剃马see….</p>

<p>但是，不论是在我们国家，还是在整个欧洲，我们中的大多数，仍然拒绝虚无主义，仍在寻找一种正义</p>

<hr />

<p>They have had to forge()….for巨…. for themselves an art of living in times of catastrophe(灾难)….可他色特废…. in order to be born a second time and to fight openly against the instinct(本能)….因死停(新余)克特…. of death at work in our history</p>

<p>我们需要锻造一种在多事之秋生活的艺术，为的是能够涅槃重生，然后坦然地与那历史进程中的死亡本能作斗争</p>

<hr />

<p>Each generation doubtless feels called upon to reform the world</p>

<p>或许，每代人都自信肩负着重塑世界的使命</p>

<hr />

<p>Mine knows that it will not reform it, but its task is perhaps even greater</p>

<p>然而，我们这代人却知道，我们对此无能为力</p>

<hr />

<p>It consists….肯see四自…. in preventing the world from destroying itself</p>

<p>但是，我们这代人的使命或许更伟大，因为我们的使命是：不让这个世界分崩离析</p>

<hr />

<p>Heir()….医生检查口腔(4声)…. to a corrupt(腐败的)….可（撸啊）[快连]普特…. history, in which are mingled()….民(1)购的…. fallen revolutions, technology gone mad, dead gods, and worn-out ideologies, where mediocre()….咪地欧克…. powers can destroy all yet no longer know how to convince, where intelligence has debased itself to become the servant(仆人)….奢问特…. of hatred and oppression, this generation starting from its own negations has had to re-establish, both within and without, a little of that which constitutes the dignity(尊严)….的哥逆剃…. of life and death</p>

<p>我们继承的，是一段残破的历史，它混杂着革命的失败、走火入魔的科技、已经死去的诸神和穷途末路的意识形态，纵使在这样的时代，任何平庸的势力都能让这个世界毁于一旦，但这种平庸的势力只有否定的力量，在理智自甘堕落成仇恨与压迫的奴隶时，这种否定的力量并不能教会我们这代人在内心和外部世界重新修建起一点点能够给予生命和死亡以尊严的东西</p>

<hr />

<p>In a world threatened by disintegration, in which our grand inquisitors(确)….赢亏着特四…. run the risk of establishing forever the kingdom of death, it knows that it should, in an insane race against the clock, restore among the nations a peace that is not servitude, reconcile()….蜕(新余)啃赛欧(4)…. anew labour()….勒bo(4声)…. and culture, and remake with all men the Ark of the Covenant(约)….咔沃嫩特….</p>

<p>在这样一个每时每刻都有可能崩塌的世界面前，我们伟大的裁判官们建立的恐怕永远是死亡的国度，而我们这代人知道，我们应该在与时间疯狂赛跑的同时，在不同民族之间，建立起一种不屈从于任何奴役的和平，重新调和工作与文化的关系，并与全世界所有人携起手来，构建一种联盟</p>

<hr />

<p>It is not certain that this generation will ever be able to accomplish(完成)….啊(2声)康普利絮…. this immense()….引men四…. task, but already it is rising everywhere in the world to the double challenge of truth and liberty(自由)….粒波剃…. and, if necessary, knows how to die for it without hate</p>

<p>没有人能够确定我们这代人是否能完成这项浩大的任务，但是，我们确定的是，他们已经遍布在全世界各个角落，为真理和自由而战，并时刻准备着为之赴死，无怨无悔</p>

<hr />

<p>Wherever it is found, it deserves to be saluted and encouraged, particularly….婆踢Q勒利…. where it is sacrificing()….杀可瑞fine性(新余)…. itself</p>

<p>正是这些人，值得我们尊敬和鼓励，无论在何时何地——尤其是在他们牺牲的地方</p>

<hr />

<p>In any event, certain of your complete approval, it is to this generation that I should like to pass on the honour that you have just given me</p>

<p>总之，我想把你们刚刚授予我的荣耀转献给他们，相信你们也会感同身受</p>

<hr />

<p>At the same time, after having outlined the nobility of the writer’s craft, I should have put him in his proper….普咯破…. place</p>

<p>与此同时，在说了作家职业的高尚之后，我想要还原作家的真实模样，除了和他的战友们一起共享的身份之外，他没有其他身份</p>

<hr />

<p>He has no other claims(索赔)….可累木自…. but those which he shares with his comrades(同志们)….康木瑞自…. in arms: vulnerable but obstinate, unjust but impassioned for justice, doing his work without shame or pride in view of everybody, not ceasing(停止)….C-sing…. to be divided(划分)….迪歪地的…. between sorrow and beauty, and devoted finally to drawing(画)….拽(4声)硬…. from his double existence the creations that he obstinately tries to erect(勃起的)….衣rect…. in the destructive movement of history</p>

<p>他既脆弱又固执；他无法永远保持公正，却又热切追寻着公正；在所有人的视线中，他默默构建着自己的作品，既不以之为耻，也不引以为傲，他永无止息地在痛苦与美好中被撕扯，最终是为了从他这双重的存在中，提炼出他固执地想要在历史的废墟中创建起来的东西</p>

<hr />

<p>Who after all this can expect from him complete solutions and high morals? Truth is mysterious, elusive, always to be conquered</p>

<p>这么说完，谁还能期待他给出现成的答案和完美的道德信条呢？真理是神秘的、难以捕捉的，总是有待征服的</p>

<hr />

<p>Liberty(自由)….粒波剃…. is dangerous, as hard to live with as it is elating(得意的)….鹅勒停(新余)….</p>

<p>自由固然是令人振奋的，但实践起来也同样是危险的、艰难的</p>

<hr />

<p>We must march toward these two goals, painfully but resolutely, certain in advance of our failings on so long a road</p>

<p>我们必须走向这两个目标，艰苦卓绝、征途漫漫，却坚定不移、矢志不渝</p>

<hr />

<p>What writer would from now on in good conscience dare set himself up as a preacher(牧师)….普瑞缺二…. of virtue? For myself, I must state once more that I am not of this kind</p>

<p>由此，哪个有着自知之明的作家还敢自诩为美德的传道者？至于我，我必须再说一次，这完全不是我的身份</p>

<hr />

<p>I have never been able to renounce the light, the pleasure of being, and the freedom in which I grew….古路…. up</p>

<p>我从来未能放弃生命中的光和幸福，不能放弃自由的生活，这些东西自小就伴随着我成长</p>

<hr />

<p>But although this nostalgia(怀旧之情)….谐音-那是他家啊…. explains many of my errors and my faults, it has doubtless helped me toward a better understanding of my craft</p>

<p>这种怀旧之情虽然也让我犯了不少错误，却无疑也帮助我更好地理解了我的职业，</p>

<hr />

<p>It is helping me still to support unquestioningly all those silent men who sustain(维持)….杀肆tain…. the life made for them in the world only through memory of the return of brief and free happiness</p>

<p>帮助我毫不犹豫地站在那些沉默的人身边，那些人，除了从回忆中追索那一点点短暂而自由的幸福，在这个世上便无以为继</p>

<hr />

<p>Thus reduced to what I really am, to my limits and debts as well as to my difficult creed, I feel freer, in concluding, to comment upon the extent and the generosity()….gene弱四剃…. of the honour you have just bestowed(赋予)….bes透的…. upon me, freer()….福瑞二…. also to tell you that I would receive it as an homage rendered to all those who, sharing in the same fight, have not received any privilege, but have on the contrary(相反)….肯缺瑞…. known misery and persecution</p>

<p>现在，我向大家还原了真实的我，你们知道了我的浅薄有限，知道了我得益于他人，也知道了我艰难的信仰，作为结束，我终于能更自如地表达诸位授予我这份荣誉的广博与慷慨，也能更自如地对你们说，我接受这份荣誉，并要把它视作为一种致敬，向所有和我一样经历了战斗，却没有获得任何殊荣，只是饱经了苦难与迫害的人致敬</p>

<hr />

<p>It remains for me to thank you from the bottom of my heart and to make before you publicly, as a personal sign of my gratitude, the same and ancient(古老的)….an神(新余)特…. promise of faithfulness which every true artist repeats to himself in silence every day</p>

<p>最后，我要发自肺腑地对诸位表示感谢，并公开地，以感恩的心，向你们作出一个古老的承诺，任何一个真正的艺术家每天都会在静默中向自己作出的古老的承诺，那便是——忠诚</p>
