CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA

（中国共产党第十九次全国代表大会部分修改，2017年10月24日通过）

Revised and adopted at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China on October 24, 2017

总纲

General Program

中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队，同时是中国人民和中华民族的先锋队，是中国特色社会主义事业的领导核心，代表中国先进生产力的发展要求，代表中国先进文化的前进方向，代表中国最广大人民的根本利益。党的最高理想和最终目标是实现共产主义。

The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation. It is the leadership core for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and represents the developmental demands of China’s advanced productive forces, the orientation for China’s advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people. The Party’s highest ideal and ultimate goal is the realization of communism.

中国共产党以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观、习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想作为自己的行动指南。

The Communist Party of China uses Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as its guides to action.

马克思列宁主义揭示了人类社会历史发展的规律，它的基本原理是正确的，具有强大的生命力。中国共产党人追求的共产主义最高理想，只有在社会主义社会充分发展和高度发达的基础上才能实现。社会主义制度的发展和完善是一个长期的历史过程。坚持马克思列宁主义的基本原理，走中国人民自愿选择的适合中国国情的道路，中国的社会主义事业必将取得最终的胜利。

Marxism-Leninism reveals the laws governing the development of the history of human society. Its basic tenets are correct and have tremendous vitality. The highest ideal of communism pursued by Chinese Communists can be realized only when socialist society is fully developed and highly advanced. The development and improvement of the socialist system is a long historical process. By upholding the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism and following the path suited to China’s specific conditions as chosen by the Chinese people, China’s socialist cause will ultimately be victorious.

以毛泽东同志为主要代表的中国共产党人，把马克思列宁主义的基本原理同中国革命的具体实践结合起来，创立了毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义在中国的运用和发展，是被实践证明了的关于中国革命和建设的正确的理论原则和经验总结，是中国共产党集体智慧的结晶。在毛泽东思想指引下，中国共产党领导全国各族人民，经过长期的反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的革命斗争，取得了新民主主义革命的胜利，建立了人民民主专政的中华人民共和国；新中国成立以后，顺利地进行了社会主义改造，完成了从新民主主义到社会主义的过渡，确立了社会主义基本制度，发展了社会主义的经济、政治和文化。

With Comrade Mao Zedong as their chief representative, Chinese Communists developed Mao Zedong Thought by combining the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the actual practice of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China; it is a body of theoretical principles and a summary of experiences, proven correct in practice, relating to China’s revolution and construction; and it is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in the long revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, securing victory in the new democratic revolution and founding the People’s Republic of China, a people’s democratic dictatorship. After the founding of the People’s Republic, the Communist Party of China successfully led the people in carrying out socialist transformation, completing the transition from New Democracy to socialism, establishing the basic socialist system, and developing a socialist economy, politics, and culture.

十一届三中全会以来，以邓小平同志为主要代表的中国共产党人，总结新中国成立以来正反两方面的经验，解放思想，实事求是，实现全党工作中心向经济建设的转移，实行改革开放，开辟了社会主义事业发展的新时期，逐步形成了建设中国特色社会主义的路线、方针、政策，阐明了在中国建设社会主义、巩固和发展社会主义的基本问题，创立了邓小平理论。邓小平理论是马克思列宁主义的基本原理同当代中国实践和时代特征相结合的产物，是毛泽东思想在新的历史条件下的继承和发展，是马克思主义在中国发展的新阶段，是当代中国的马克思主义，是中国共产党集体智慧的结晶，引导着我国社会主义现代化事业不断前进。

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their chief representative, analyzed both positive and negative experience gained since the founding of the People’s Republic, emancipated the mind, and sought truth from facts. They shifted the focus of the whole Party’s work onto economic development and introduced reform and opening up, thereby ushering in a new era of development in socialism; they gradually formulated the line, principles, and policies for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, brought clarity to basic questions on building, consolidating, and developing socialism in China, and thus established Deng Xiaoping Theory. Deng Xiaoping Theory is the product of combining Marxism-Leninism’s basic tenets with practice in contemporary China and the particular features of the era; it is a continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions; it represents a new stage for the development of Marxism in China; it is the Marxism of contemporary China and a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China; and it guides the continuous progression of China’s socialist modernization.

十三届四中全会以来，以江泽民同志为主要代表的中国共产党人，在建设中国特色社会主义的实践中，加深了对什么是社会主义、怎样建设社会主义和建设什么样的党、怎样建设党的认识，积累了治党治国新的宝贵经验，形成了“三个代表”重要思想。“三个代表”重要思想是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论的继承和发展，反映了当代世界和中国的发展变化对党和国家工作的新要求，是加强和改进党的建设、推进我国社会主义自我完善和发展的强大理论武器，是中国共产党集体智慧的结晶，是党必须长期坚持的指导思想。始终做到“三个代表”，是我们党的立党之本、执政之基、力量之源。

After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as their chief representative, through developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in practice, deepened their understanding of what socialism is and how to build it, and what kind of party to build and how to build it, and gathered valuable new experience in governing the Party and the country, thus forming the Theory of Three Represents. The Theory of Three Represents, which is a continuation and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping Theory, reflects new demands that the developments and changes in today’s world and in China have placed on the Party and the government in their work. A powerful theoretical tool for strengthening and improving Party building and promoting the self-improvement and development of China’s socialism, it is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China and a guiding ideology that the Party must uphold in the long term. Always ensuring the Theory of Three Represents is practiced is the foundation of the Party’s own development, the cornerstone of governance by the Party, and the source of the Party’s strength.

十六大以来，以胡锦涛同志为主要代表的中国共产党人，坚持以邓小平理论和“三个代表”重要思想为指导，根据新的发展要求，深刻认识和回答了新形势下实现什么样的发展、怎样发展等重大问题，形成了以人为本、全面协调可持续发展的科学发展观。科学发展观是同马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想既一脉相承又与时俱进的科学理论，是马克思主义关于发展的世界观和方法论的集中体现，是马克思主义中国化重大成果，是中国共产党集体智慧的结晶，是发展中国特色社会主义必须长期坚持的指导思想。

After the Party’s 16th National Congress, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Hu Jintao as their chief representative, continued to take Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Theory of Three Represents as their guide. On the basis of the new demands of development they forged a deep understanding of and answered major questions, including what kind of development to pursue and how to pursue it in a new situation, thus forming the Scientific Outlook on Development, which puts people first and calls for comprehensive, balanced, and sustainable development. The Scientific Outlook on Development is a scientific theory that continues in congruence with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the Theory of Three Represents, while advancing with the times. It fully embodies the Marxist worldview and methodology on development and represents a major achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context. It is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China and a guiding ideology that must be upheld long term in developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.

十八大以来，以习近平同志为主要代表的中国共产党人，顺应时代发展，从理论和实践结合上系统回答了新时代坚持和发展什么样的中国特色社会主义、怎样坚持和发展中国特色社会主义这个重大时代课题，创立了习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想。习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观的继承和发展，是马克思主义中国化最新成果，是党和人民实践经验和集体智慧的结晶，是中国特色社会主义理论体系的重要组成部分，是全党全国人民为实现中华民族伟大复兴而奋斗的行动指南，必须长期坚持并不断发展。在习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想指导下，中国共产党领导全国各族人民，统揽伟大斗争、伟大工程、伟大事业、伟大梦想，推动中国特色社会主义进入了新时代。

Since the Party’s 18th National Congress, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Xi Jinping as their chief representative, in response to contemporary developments and by integrating theory with practice, have systematically addressed the major question of our times—what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics the new era requires us to uphold and develop and how we should uphold and develop it, thus giving shape to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The Thought is a continuation and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It is the latest achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context, a crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people, an important component of the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a guide to action for the entire Party and all the Chinese people to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and must be upheld long term and constantly developed. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to carry out a great struggle, develop a great project, advance a great cause, and realize a great dream, ushering in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

改革开放以来我们取得一切成绩和进步的根本原因，归结起来就是：开辟了中国特色社会主义道路，形成了中国特色社会主义理论体系，确立了中国特色社会主义制度，发展了中国特色社会主义文化。全党同志要倍加珍惜、长期坚持和不断发展党历经艰辛开创的这条道路、这个理论体系、这个制度、这个文化，高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，坚定道路自信、理论自信、制度自信、文化自信，贯彻党的基本理论、基本路线、基本方略，为实现推进现代化建设、完成祖国统一、维护世界和平与促进共同发展这三大历史任务，实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦而奋斗。

Ultimately, the fundamental reason for all of China’s achievements and progress since reform and opening up began is that the Party has forged a path, formed a theoretical system, established a system, and developed a culture for socialism with Chinese characteristics. All Party members must cherish deeply, uphold long term, and continue to develop this path, this theoretical system, this socialist system, and this culture, which the Party has developed through great hardship. All Party members must hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, have firm confidence in its path, theory, system, and culture, implement the Party’s basic theory, basic line, and basic policy, and strive to fulfill the three historic tasks of advancing modernization, achieving China’s reunification, and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development, achieve the two centenary goals, and realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.

我国正处于并将长期处于社会主义初级阶段。这是在原本经济文化落后的中国建设社会主义现代化不可逾越的历史阶段，需要上百年的时间。我国的社会主义建设，必须从我国的国情出发，走中国特色社会主义道路。在现阶段，我国社会的主要矛盾是人民日益增长的美好生活需要和不平衡不充分的发展之间的矛盾。由于国内的因素和国际的影响，阶级斗争还在一定范围内长期存在，在某种条件下还有可能激化，但已经不是主要矛盾。我国社会主义建设的根本任务，是进一步解放生产力，发展生产力，逐步实现社会主义现代化，并且为此而改革生产关系和上层建筑中不适应生产力发展的方面和环节。必须坚持和完善公有制为主体、多种所有制经济共同发展的基本经济制度，坚持和完善按劳分配为主体、多种分配方式并存的分配制度，鼓励一部分地区和一部分人先富起来，逐步消灭贫穷，达到共同富裕，在生产发展和社会财富增长的基础上不断满足人民日益增长的美好生活需要，促进人的全面发展。发展是我们党执政兴国的第一要务。必须坚持以人民为中心的发展思想，坚持创新、协调、绿色、开放、共享的发展理念。各项工作都要把有利于发展社会主义社会的生产力，有利于增强社会主义国家的综合国力，有利于提高人民的生活水平，作为总的出发点和检验标准，尊重劳动、尊重知识、尊重人才、尊重创造，做到发展为了人民、发展依靠人民、发展成果由人民共享。跨入新世纪，我国进入全面建设小康社会、加快推进社会主义现代化的新的发展阶段。必须按照中国特色社会主义事业“五位一体”总体布局和“四个全面”战略布局，统筹推进经济建设、政治建设、文化建设、社会建设、生态文明建设，协调推进全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党。在新世纪新时代，经济和社会发展的战略目标是，到建党一百年时，全面建成小康社会；到新中国成立一百年时，全面建成社会主义现代化强国。

China is currently in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come. This is a stage of history that cannot be bypassed as China, which used to be economically and culturally lagging, makes progress in socialist modernization; it will take over a century. China’s development of socialism must begin from China’s own circumstances and must follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the present stage, the principal contradiction in Chinese society is that between the ever-growing needs of the people for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. Owing to both domestic factors and international influences, a certain amount of class struggle will continue to exist for a long time to come, and under certain circumstances may even grow more pronounced, however, it is no longer the principal contradiction. In building socialism in China, the basic tasks are to further release and develop the productive forces and gradually achieve socialist modernization and, to this end, reform those elements and areas within the relations of production and the superstructure that are unsuited to the development of the productive forces. The Party must uphold and improve the basic economic system whereby public ownership plays a dominant role and economic entities under diverse forms of ownership develop side by side. It must maintain and improve the distribution system whereby distribution according to labor is dominant and a variety of other modes of distribution exist alongside it. It must encourage some areas and some people to become well-off first, gradually eliminate poverty, achieve common prosperity, and on the basis of developing production and social wealth, keep meeting the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life and promote people’s well-rounded development. Development is the Party’s top priority in governing and rejuvenating the country. The Party must commit to a people-centered philosophy of development and pursue the vision of innovative, coordinated, green, and open development that is for everyone. The general starting point and criteria for judging each item of the Party’s work are that it must benefit the development of the socialist productive forces, be conducive to increasing socialist China’s overall strength, and help to improve the people’s living standards. The Party must respect labor, knowledge, talent, and creativity and ensure that development is for the people and relies on the people, and that its fruits are shared among the people. The beginning of the new century marked China’s entry into a new stage of development in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and accelerating socialist modernization. In accordance with the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party must promote coordinated economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological advancement, and coordinate efforts to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, comprehensively deepen reform, fully advance the law-based governance of China, and strengthen Party self-governance in every respect. In this new era in the new century, the strategic objectives of economic and social development are to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects by the time the Party marks its centenary and to build China into a great modern socialist country in every dimension by the time the People’s Republic celebrates its centenary.

中国共产党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线是：领导和团结全国各族人民，以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，自力更生，艰苦创业，为把我国建设成为富强民主文明和谐美丽的社会主义现代化强国而奋斗。

The basic line of the Communist Party of China in the primary stage of socialism is to lead all the people of China together in a self-reliant and pioneering effort, making economic development the central task, upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, and remaining committed to reform and opening up, so as to see China becomes a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful.

In leading the cause of socialism, the Communist Party of China must continue its commitment to economic development as the central task, and all other work must take an ancillary role and serve this center.

坚持社会主义道路、坚持人民民主专政、坚持中国共产党的领导、坚持马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想这四项基本原则，是我们的立国之本。在社会主义现代化建设的整个过程中，必须坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化。

The Four Cardinal Principles—to keep to the path of socialism, to uphold the people’s democratic dictatorship, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and to uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought—form the foundation for building the country. Throughout the whole course of socialist modernization, the Party must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization.

坚持改革开放，是我们的强国之路。只有改革开放，才能发展中国、发展社会主义、发展马克思主义。要全面深化改革，完善和发展中国特色社会主义制度，推进国家治理体系和治理能力现代化。要从根本上改革束缚生产力发展的经济体制，坚持和完善社会主义市场经济体制；与此相适应，要进行政治体制改革和其他领域的改革。要坚持对外开放的基本国策，吸收和借鉴人类社会创造的一切文明成果。改革开放应当大胆探索，勇于开拓，提高改革决策的科学性，更加注重改革的系统性、整体性、协同性，在实践中开创新路。

中国共产党要领导全国各族人民实现“两个一百年”奋斗目标、实现中华民族伟大复兴的中国梦，必须紧密围绕党的基本路线，坚持党要管党、全面从严治党，加强党的长期执政能力建设、先进性和纯洁性建设，以改革创新精神全面推进党的建设新的伟大工程，以党的政治建设为统领，全面推进党的政治建设、思想建设、组织建设、作风建设、纪律建设，把制度建设贯穿其中，深入推进反腐败斗争，全面提高党的建设科学化水平。坚持立党为公、执政为民，发扬党的优良传统和作风，不断提高党的领导水平和执政水平，提高拒腐防变和抵御风险的能力，不断增强自我净化、自我完善、自我革新、自我提高能力，不断增强党的阶级基础和扩大党的群众基础，不断提高党的创造力、凝聚力、战斗力，建设学习型、服务型、创新型的马克思主义执政党，使我们党始终走在时代前列，成为领导全国人民沿着中国特色社会主义道路不断前进的坚强核心。党的建设必须坚决实现以下五项基本要求：

To lead the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to achieve the two centenary goals and realize the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation, the Communist Party of China must follow its basic line; exercise self-supervision and strengthen self-governance in every respect; strengthen its long-term governance capacity, its advanced nature, and its purity; and, in the spirit of reform and innovation, make comprehensive moves to press ahead with the great new project of Party building. It must take enhancing its political building as the overarching principle and make comprehensive efforts to ensure that the Party’s political work is stressed, ideology is strengthened, organizations are consolidated, conduct is improved, and discipline is maintained, institutional development is always emphasized, and the fight against corruption keeps going, thus building the Party more effectively in all respects. It must uphold the principle that the Party builds itself in the interests of, and exercises governance for, the people, and see that its fine traditions and positive work style continue to thrive. It must constantly work to improve the way it exercises leadership and governance and strengthen its ability to resist corruption, prevent moral decline, and withstand risks. It must constantly strengthen its ability to purify, improve, reform, and excel itself. It must constantly strengthen its class foundation, expand its mass base, enhance its creativity, cohesion, and readiness to meet challenges, and build itself up as an ever-learning, service-oriented, and innovative Marxist governing party. The Party should thus be able to forever stand at the forefront of the times and become a strong core capable of leading all the people of China as they continue to advance along the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In building itself, the Party must work with firm resolve to meet the following five fundamental requirements.

第一，坚持党的基本路线。全党要用邓小平理论、“三个代表”重要思想、科学发展观、习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想和党的基本路线统一思想，统一行动，并且毫不动摇地长期坚持下去。必须把改革开放同四项基本原则统一起来，全面落实党的基本路线，反对一切“左”的和右的错误倾向，要警惕右，但主要是防止“左”。加强各级领导班子建设，培养选拔党和人民需要的好干部，培养和造就千百万社会主义事业接班人，从组织上保证党的基本理论、基本路线、基本方略的贯彻落实。

1. Adherence to the Party’s basic line. The whole Party must use Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and the Party’s basic line to achieve unity in thought and action, and must resolutely continue to do so in the long term. The Party must ensure that reform and opening up are carried out in unity with the Four Cardinal Principles, put its basic line into effect in all fields of endeavor, and combat all mistaken tendencies of the “Left” and Right, maintaining vigilance against Rightist tendencies, but primarily defending against “Leftist” tendencies. The Party must strengthen work to improve leading bodies at all levels, training and selecting the good officials that our Party and people need, and it must cultivate and train millions of successors to continue the cause of socialism, thus ensuring organizationally that the Party’s basic theory, basic line, and basic policy are fully implemented and applied.

第二，坚持解放思想，实事求是，与时俱进，求真务实。党的思想路线是一切从实际出发，理论联系实际，实事求是，在实践中检验真理和发展真理。全党必须坚持这条思想路线，积极探索，大胆试验，开拓创新，创造性地开展工作，不断研究新情况，总结新经验，解决新问题，在实践中丰富和发展马克思主义，推进马克思主义中国化。

2. Commitment to emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, advancing with the times, and being realistic and pragmatic. The Party’s line of thinking is to proceed from reality in all it does, to integrate theory with practice, to seek truth from facts, and to verify and develop truths through practice. All Party members must uphold this line of thinking, actively exploring and boldly experimenting, breaking ground and making innovations, and working with creativity; never cease to study new situations, reflect on new experiences, and solve new problems; and enrich and develop Marxism through practice and advance the adaption of Marxism to the Chinese context.

第三，坚持全心全意为人民服务。党除了工人阶级和最广大人民群众的利益，没有自己特殊的利益。党在任何时候都把群众利益放在第一位，同群众同甘共苦，保持最密切的联系，坚持权为民所用、情为民所系、利为民所谋，不允许任何党员脱离群众，凌驾于群众之上。我们党的最大政治优势是密切联系群众，党执政后的最大危险是脱离群众。党风问题、党同人民群众联系问题是关系党生死存亡的问题。党在自己的工作中实行群众路线，一切为了群众，一切依靠群众，从群众中来，到群众中去，把党的正确主张变为群众的自觉行动。

3. Dedication to wholeheartedly serving the people. Besides the interests of the working class and the broadest possible majority of the people, the Party has no special interests of its own. It shall, at all times, give top priority to the interests of the people, share weal and woe with them, and maintain the closest possible ties with them. It shall exercise power for the people, demonstrate concern for them, and work in their interests, never allowing any member to become disengaged from the people or to behave as if they are above them. The biggest political advantage the Party has is its close ties with the people while the biggest potential danger it faces as a governing party is becoming distanced from them. Party conduct and the Party’s ties with the people are of paramount importance to the Party. In its own work, the Party shall follow the mass line, seeing that everything is for the people and everything relies on the people, exercising the principle of “from the people, to the people,” and translating the correct ideas of the Party into the voluntary action of the people.

第四，坚持民主集中制。民主集中制是民主基础上的集中和集中指导下的民主相结合。它既是党的根本组织原则，也是群众路线在党的生活中的运用。必须充分发扬党内民主，尊重党员主体地位，保障党员民主权利，发挥各级党组织和广大党员的积极性创造性。必须实行正确的集中，牢固树立政治意识、大局意识、核心意识、看齐意识，坚定维护以习近平同志为核心的党中央权威和集中统一领导，保证全党的团结统一和行动一致，保证党的决定得到迅速有效的贯彻执行。加强和规范党内政治生活，增强党内政治生活的政治性、时代性、原则性、战斗性，发展积极健康的党内政治文化，营造风清气正的良好政治生态。党在自己的政治生活中正确地开展批评和自我批评，在原则问题上进行思想斗争，坚持真理，修正错误。努力造成又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅生动活泼的政治局面。

4. Resolve in upholding democratic centralism. Democratic centralism combines centralism built on the basis of democracy with democracy under centralized guidance. It is both the Party’s fundamental organizational principle and the application of the mass line in everyday Party activities. The Party must fully encourage intraparty democracy, respect the principal position of its members, safeguard their democratic rights, and give play to the initiative and creativity of Party organizations at every level and all Party members. Correct centralism must be practiced; all Party members must keep firmly in mind the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, uphold the leadership core, and keep in alignment, and firmly uphold the authority and centralized, unified leadership of the Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, so as to ensure the solidarity, unity, and concerted action of the whole Party and guarantee the prompt and effective implementation of the Party’s decisions. The Party shall strengthen and regulate political activities within itself; make intraparty political activities more politically oriented, up-to-date, principled, and effective; cultivate a positive and healthy intraparty political culture; and foster a sound political ecosystem featuring honesty and integrity within the Party. In its internal political activities, the Party shall conduct correctly criticism and self-criticism, engage in debate over matters of principle, and uphold truth and rectify mistakes. The Party shall work hard to create a lively political situation featuring both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, and both unity of will and personal sense of ease.

第五，坚持从严管党治党。全面从严治党永远在路上。新形势下，党面临的执政考验、改革开放考验、市场经济考验、外部环境考验是长期的、复杂的、严峻的，精神懈怠危险、能力不足危险、脱离群众危险、消极腐败危险更加尖锐地摆在全党面前。要把严的标准、严的措施贯穿于管党治党全过程和各方面。坚持依规治党、标本兼治，坚持把纪律挺在前面，加强组织性纪律性，在党的纪律面前人人平等。强化管党治党主体责任和监督责任，加强对党的领导机关和党员领导干部特别是主要领导干部的监督，不断完善党内监督体系。深入推进党风廉政建设和反腐败斗争，以零容忍态度惩治腐败，构建不敢腐、不能腐、不想腐的有效机制。

5. Firmness in exercising strict self-supervision and self-governance. Ensuring Party self-governance is exercised fully and strictly is a journey to which there is no end. Under the new circumstances, the tests the Party faces in governance, reform and opening up, the market economy, and the external environment are protracted, complicated, and serious; the dangers of a lack of drive, incompetence, disengagement from the people, inaction, and corruption are more pointedly confronting the whole Party. The Party shall see that strict standards and measures are applied throughout the process and in all aspects of its self-supervision and self-governance. The Party shall ensure self-governance is carried out in accordance with regulations and both symptoms and root causes of problems are addressed. The Party must give top priority to ensuring compliance with Party discipline, help its members become more organization conscious and have a stronger sense of discipline, and work to see that every member is equal before Party discipline. The Party shall ensure the principal and oversight responsibilities for the Party’s self-supervision and self-governance are fully assumed; oversight of leading Party organs and of Party members in leadership positions, particularly those holding principal leadership positions, is strengthened; and the internal oversight system is constantly improved. The Party shall step up efforts to improve conduct, build integrity, and combat corruption; apply a zero-tolerance policy on corruption; and establish effective mechanisms to ensure officials do not dare, are not able, and have no desire to be corrupt.

中国共产党的领导是中国特色社会主义最本质的特征，是中国特色社会主义制度的最大优势。党政军民学，东西南北中，党是领导一切的。党要适应改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的要求，坚持科学执政、民主执政、依法执政，加强和改善党的领导。党必须按照总揽全局、协调各方的原则，在同级各种组织中发挥领导核心作用。党必须集中精力领导经济建设，组织、协调各方面的力量，同心协力，围绕经济建设开展工作，促进经济社会全面发展。党必须实行民主的科学的决策，制定和执行正确的路线、方针、政策，做好党的组织工作和宣传教育工作，发挥全体党员的先锋模范作用。党必须在宪法和法律的范围内活动。党必须保证国家的立法、司法、行政、监察机关，经济、文化组织和人民团体积极主动地、独立负责地、协调一致地工作。党必须加强对工会、共产主义青年团、妇女联合会等群团组织的领导，使它们保持和增强政治性、先进性、群众性，充分发挥作用。党必须适应形势的发展和情况的变化，完善领导体制，改进领导方式，增强执政能力。共产党员必须同党外群众亲密合作，共同为建设中国特色社会主义而奋斗。

Leadership of the Communist Party of China is the most essential attribute of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the greatest strength of this system. The Party exercises overall leadership over all areas of endeavor in every part of the country. The Party must adapt to the demands of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, remain committed to practicing scientific, democratic, and law-based governance, and strengthen and improve its leadership. The Party must, acting on the principle of guiding the overall situation and coordinating the work of all sides, assume the role of leadership core among all other organizations at the corresponding levels. The Party must concentrate on leading economic development, organize and coordinate the strengths of all by uniting hearts and actions to focus work on economic development, and promote all-around economic and social development. The Party must practice democratic and scientific decision-making; formulate and implement the correct lines, principles, and policies; carry out its organizational, publicity, and educational work to proper effect; and give play to the exemplary and vanguard role of all Party members. The Party must act within the scope of the country’s Constitution and the law. It must ensure that the legislative, judicial, administrative, and supervisory organs of the state, economic and cultural organizations, and people’s organizations work actively on their own initiative, independently, responsibly, and cooperatively. The Party must strengthen its leadership over trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women’s federations, and other people’s group organizations, ensure they preserve and strengthen their political consciousness, advanced nature, and orientation toward the people, and give full play to their roles. The Party must adapt to developments and changing circumstances, improving its leadership system and style of leadership and strengthening its capacity for governance. Party members must cooperate closely with people outside the Party, endeavoring together to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.

第四十条　党的纪律主要包括政治纪律、组织纪律、廉洁纪律、群众纪律、工作纪律、生活纪律。

Party organizations shall reprimand and educate, or take disciplinary action against, members who have violated Party discipline, depending on the nature and seriousness of their mistakes, in keeping with the principle of learning from mistakes to prevent recurrence, treating the illness to save the patient, exercising strict discipline enforcement, holding every violator accountable, and discovering problems early and correcting them when they are nascent. The four forms of oversight and discipline enforcement shall be exercised, ensuring that those who have committed minor misconduct are made to “redden and sweat”; that penalties and organizational adjustments to official positions are employed as important means of Party self-supervision and self-governance; and that those who have committed serious disciplinary and/or criminal violations are expelled from the Party.

Article 42: Any disciplinary action to be taken against a Party member must be discussed and decided on at a general meeting of Party branch, and reported to the primary-level Party committee for approval. In the event that the issues involved are particularly important or complicated, or if a member is to be expelled from the Party, the case shall be reported to a Party commission for discipline inspection for examination and approval at the county level or above depending on the specific circumstances of the case. In exceptional circumstances, a Party committee or a commission for discipline inspection at or above the county level has the authority to decide directly on the disciplinary action to be taken against a Party member.

对党的中央委员会委员、候补委员，给以警告、严重警告处分，由中央纪律检查委员会常务委员会审议后，报党中央批准。对地方各级党的委员会委员、候补委员，给以警告、严重警告处分，应由上一级纪律检查委员会批准，并报它的同级党的委员会备案。

Any decision to give a member or alternate member of the Central Committee a warning or severe warning shall be examined by the Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and then submitted to the Central Committee for approval. Any decision to give a member or alternate member of a local Party committee at any level a warning or severe warning shall be submitted to the commission for discipline inspection at the next level up for approval and reported to the Party committee at the same level as the commission to be put on record.

对党的中央委员会和地方各级委员会的委员、候补委员，给以撤销党内职务、留党察看或开除党籍的处分，必须由本人所在的委员会全体会议三分之二以上的多数决定。在全体会议闭会期间，可以先由中央政治局和地方各级委员会常务委员会作出处理决定，待召开委员会全体会议时予以追认。对地方各级委员会委员和候补委员的上述处分，必须经过上级纪律检查委员会常务委员会审议，由这一级纪律检查委员会报同级党的委员会批准。

When the plenary meeting is not in session, the decision may be taken first by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee or the standing committee of a local Party committee while awaiting confirmation at the plenary meeting of the Party committee. The use of such actions in disciplining a member or alternate member of a local Party committee is subject to examination by the standing committee of the commission for discipline inspection at the next level up and shall then be submitted by the commission for discipline inspection to the Party committee at the same level as the commission for approval.

严重触犯刑律的中央委员会委员、候补委员，由中央政治局决定开除其党籍；严重触犯刑律的地方各级委员会委员、候补委员，由同级委员会常务委员会决定开除其党籍。

The expulsion from the Party of a member or alternate member of the Central Committee who has committed a serious criminal violation shall be decided upon by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee; the expulsion of a member or alternate member of a local Party committee at any level who has committed a serious criminal violation shall be decided upon by the standing committee of the Party committee at the corresponding level.

第四十三条　党组织对党员作出处分决定，应当实事求是地查清事实。处分决定所依据的事实材料和处分决定必须同本人见面，听取本人说明情况和申辩。如果本人对处分决定不服，可以提出申诉，有关党组织必须负责处理或者迅速转递，不得扣压。对于确属坚持错误意见和无理要求的人，要给以批评教育。

Article 43: When a Party organization is deciding on disciplinary action against a Party member, it should investigate and verify the facts as objectively as possible. The Party member in question must be shown the disciplinary decision and the facts it is based on, and be given the chance to offer an explanation and speak in his or her own defense. If the member does not accept the decision, he or she may appeal, and the Party organization concerned must promptly manage or forward the appeal, and must not withhold or suppress it. Those who persist with mistaken views or unjustifiable claims shall be subject to reprimand and education.

第四十四条　党组织如果在维护党的纪律方面失职，必须问责。

Article 44: Should a Party organization fail to uphold Party discipline, it must be held accountable.

对于严重违犯党的纪律、本身又不能纠正的党组织，上一级党的委员会在查明核实后，应根据情节严重的程度，作出进行改组或予以解散的决定，并报再上一级党的委员会审查批准，正式宣布执行。

In the event that a Party organization seriously violates Party discipline and is unable to rectify the mistake on its own, the Party committee at the next level up should, after establishing and verifying the facts, make a decision to reorganize or dissolve the organization based on the seriousness of the case, report this decision to the Party committee at the next level up for examination and approval, and then formally announce and execute the decision.
