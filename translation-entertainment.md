### 红色高跟鞋

该怎么去形容你最贴切

拿什么跟你作比较才算特别

对你的感觉 强烈

却又不太了解 只凭直觉

你像窝在被子里的舒服

却又像风 捉摸不住

像手腕上散发的香水味

像爱不释手的 红色高跟鞋

该怎么去形容你最贴切

拿什么跟你作比较才算特别

对你的感觉 强烈

却又不太了解 只凭直觉

你像窝在被子里的舒服

却又像风 捉摸不住

像手腕上散发的香水味

像爱不释手的 红色高跟鞋

你像窝在被子里的舒服

却又像风 捉摸不住

像手腕上散发的香水味

像爱不释手的

我爱你有种左灯右行的冲突

疯狂却怕没有退路

你能否让我停止这种追逐

就这么双 最后唯一的

红色高跟鞋

## In My Secret Life
I saw you this morning

You were moving so fast

Can't seem to loosen my grip

On the past

And I miss you so much

There's no one in sight

And we're still making love

In My Secret Life

I smile when I'm angry

I cheat and I lie

I do what I have to do

To get by

But I know what is wrong

And I know what is right

And I'd die for the truth

In My Secret Life

Hold on, hold on, my brother

My sister, hold on tight

I finally got my orders

I'll be marching through the morning

Marching through the night

Moving cross the borders

Of My Secret Life

Looked through the paper

Makes you want to cry

Nobody cares if the people

Live or die

And the dealer wants you thinking

That it's either black or white

Thank God it's not that simple

In My Secret Life

I bite my lip

I buy what I'm told

From the latest hit

To the wisdom of old

But I'm always alone

And my heart is like ice

And it's crowded and cold

In My Secret Life
