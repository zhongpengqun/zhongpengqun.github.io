### Tibet










PRESIDENT JIANG: I'm sorry, I have to take up an additional five minutes. I'd like to say a few words on Dalai Lama. President Clinton is also interested in this question, in dalai lama. Actually, since the Dalai Lama left in 1959, earth-shaking changes have taken place in Tibet.

First, the system of theocracy has forever become bygone, but though it is unfortunate that the disappearance of this theocracy was much later than the demise of theocracy in Europe, before the Renaissance. And the more than 1 million serfs under the rule of the dalai lama were liberated.

In 1990, when I was in Tibet, I went to visit the liberated serfs. And now the system of national autonomy is in practice in Tibet. And the people there, they have their Tibetan autonomous region government. Since I came to work in the central government, I have urged the 29 sovereign municipalities and autonomous regions to assist Tibet in its development, even including those provinces that are not very developed, such as Chinghai province. So, altogether, nearly 8 billion yuan of financial resources were raised, and already 62 projects have been completed in Tibet.

As for the freedom of religious belief, there is clear stipulation in our constitution for the protection of religious belief, and this also includes in Tibet. And we have also spent a lot of money in renovating the lamastories and the temples in Tibet, and we have spent 100 million yuan and one ton of gold in renovating the Potelev palace.

Just now, President Clinton also mentioned the Tibetan issue and the dialogue with the dalai lama. Actually, as long as the dalai lama can publicly make a statement and a commitment that Tibet is an inalienable part of China and that he must also recognize Taiwan as a province of China, then the door to dialogue and negotiation is open. Actually, we are having several channels of communications with the Dalai Lama. So I hope the dalai lama will make positive response in this regard.

Finally, I want to emphasize that according to Chinese constitution, the freedom of religious belief in Tibet, and also throughout China, is protected. But as the president of the People's Republic of China and as a member of the Communist Party, I myself am an atheist. But this will by no means affect my respect for the religious freedom in Tibet.

But still, I have a question. That is, during my visit to the United States last year, and also during my previous visit to other European countries, I found that although the education and the science and the technology have developed to a very high level and the people are now enjoying modern civilization, still quite a number of them have a belief in lamaism. So this is a question that I'm still studying and still looking into. I want to find out the reason why.

I think President Clinton is a strong defender of the American interest, and I am a strong defender of the Chinese interest. But despite that, we still can have very friendly exchanges of views and discussion. And I think that is democracy. And I want to stress that actually there are a lot of areas in which we can learn from each other.

(In English.) If you agree, we will finish this.

PRESIDENT CLINTON: I agree, but you have to let me say one thing about the Dalai Lama. (Laughter.) First, I agree that Tibet is a part of China, an autonomous region of China. And I can understand why the acknowledgment of that would be a precondition of dialogue with the Dalai Lama. But I also believe that there are many, many Tibetans who still revere the Dalai Lama and view him as their spiritual leader.

President Jiang pointed out that he has a few followers of Tibetan Buddhism even in the United States and Europe. But most of his followers have not given up their own religious faith. He has followers who are Christians -- supporters -- excuse me, not followers, supporters -- who are Christians, who are Jews, who are Muslims, who believe in the unity of God and who believe he is a holy man.

But for us, the question is not fundamentally religious. It is political. That is, we believe that other people should have the right to fully practice their religious beliefs and that if he, in good faith, presents himself on those terms, it is a legitimate thing for China to engage him in dialogue.

And let me say something that will perhaps be unpopular with everyone. I have spent time with the dalai lama. I believe him to be an honest man. And I believe if he had a conversation with President Jiang, they would like each other very much. (Laughs.)

(Laughter.)

PRESIDENT JIANG: (In English.) Thank you for your attention.


		







### HongKong Jo
P1 Elder Jiang怒斥香港记者完整语录
2000年10月27日，香港女记者张宝华问及是否「钦点」董建华连任行政长官，面对香港记者不断的追问，表示这帮香港记者水平有限，并作出有关回应。


注：新闻二台与翡翠台针对此段发言所配字幕稍有不同。例如，对于原话「闷声大发财」，新闻二台用的是「发大财」，而翡翠台用的是「大发财」；除此之外，很多口语细节都没有在字幕中反映出来。有鉴于此，本段语录尽量根据江的原话进行编写。视频详见有线新闻台版本和翡翠台版本。

注：此次访问时江泽民在说普通话的同时夹杂粤语、英语，下面会将原文标出，粤语、英语使用斜体，必要时附上翻译。

张：江主席，你觉得董先生连任好不好啊？

江：好啊。

张：中央也支持他吗？


江：对啊，当然啦。


张：那为什么这么早就提出了，有没有别的人选呢？


张：欧盟呢最近发表了一个报告说呢……呃……北京会透过一些渠道去影响、干预香港的法治，你对这个看法有什么回应呢？


江：没听过这个事。

张：是彭定康说的。

江：彭定康说的就是真的啦？你们媒体千万要注意啊，不要“见着风，是得雨”啊。接到这些消息，你媒体本身也要判断，明白意思吗？假使这些完全……无中生有的东西，你再帮他说一遍，你等于……你也等于……你也有责任吧？

张：现在呢那么早呢你们就是说支持董先生呢，会不会给人一种感觉就是内定了、欽点了董先生呢？

江：没有任何（内定、钦点）的意思。还是按照香港的……按照基本法、按照选举的法——去产生……

张：但是你们那么……

江：你……刚才你问我啊，我可以回答你一句“无可奉告”，那你们又不高兴，那怎么办？

张：那董先生……

江：我讲的意思不是我是钦点他当下一任。你问我不支……支持不支持，我是支持的。我就明确地给你告诉这一点。

张：江主席……

江：我觉得你们啊，你们……我感觉你们新闻界还要学习一个，你们非常熟悉西方的这一套 value。你们毕竟还 too young（太年轻），明白这意思吧。我告诉你们我是身经百战了，见得多了！啊，西方的哪一个国家我没去过？媒体他们——你……你们要知道，美国的华莱士，那比你们不知道高到哪里去了。啊，我跟他谈笑风生！所以说媒体啊，要……还是要提高自己的知识水平！懂我的意思——識得唔識得啊？（懂不懂啊？）

江：唉，我也给你们着急啊，真的。

江：你们真的……我以为……遍地……你们有一个好，全世界跑到什么地方，你们比其他的西方记者啊，跑得还快。但是呢，问来问去的问题啊，都 too simple（太肤浅），啊，sometimes naïve!（有时很幼稚）懂了没有啊？

张：那江主席，你觉得……

江：識得唔識得啊？（懂不懂啊？）
（一片嘈杂声）

记者：但是能不能说一下为甚麽支持董建华呢？

江：我很抱歉，我今天是作为一个长者给你们讲的。我不是新闻工作者，但是我见得太多了，我……我有这个必要告诉你们一点，人生的经验。

江：我刚才呢……我刚才我很想啊，就是我每一次碰到你们我就讲中国有一句话叫「闷声大发财」，我就什么话也不说。這是最好的！但是我想，我见到你们这样热情啊，一句话不说也不好。所以你刚才你一定要——在宣传上将来如果你们报道上有偏差，你们要负责的。我没有说要钦定（董建华），没有任何这个意思。但是你问……你一定要非得要问我……对董先生支持不支持。我们不支持他？他现在是当特首，我们怎么能不支持特首？

记者：但是如果说连任呢？

江：对不对？

江：诶，连任也要按照香港的法律啊，对不对？要要……要按照香港的……当然我们的决定权也是很重要的。香港的特区……特别行政区是属于中国……人民共和（中华人民共和国）的中央人民政府啊。啊？到那个时候我们会表态的！

记者：但是呢……

江：明白这意思吧？

江：你们啊，不要想……喜欢……弄个大新闻，说现在已经钦定了，再把我批判一番。

记者：不是，但是呢就是……

江：你们啊，naïve!（幼稚！）

记者：但是呢就是……

保安人员：好好好OKOK……

江：I'm angry!（我生气了！）我跟你讲啊，你们这样子啊，是不行的！

保安人员：好好好，请大家离场。

江：我今天算是得罪了你们一下！
